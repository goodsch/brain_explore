    "text": "I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's CLI for code exploration. I'm ready to help you search and analyze the codebase at `/home/chris/dev/projects/codex/brain_explore`.\n\nI understand:\n- **READ-ONLY MODE**: I can only search and analyze existing code\n- **No file modifications**: No creating, editing, deleting, or moving files\n- **My strengths**: Finding files with glob patterns, searching with regex, reading specific files\n- **Best tools**: Glob for broad patterns, Grep for content search, Read for specific files, Bash for read-only operations only\n\nI've reviewed the project context:\n- This is a **brain_explore** workspace for building a therapeutic worldview framework\n- The project has SiYuan integration planned with MCP tools for research\n- Current structure uses local directories until SiYuan is fully connected\n- There are progress tracking files and multiple content tracks (Human Mind Theory, Change Process Model, Therapist Method System)\n\nI'm ready to help you explore the codebase. What would you like me to search for or analyze?"
