    "text": "I'm ready to assist! I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's official CLI for Claude, operating in read-only mode for file search and code exploration.\n\nI understand the constraints:\n- STRICTLY read-only — no file creation, modification, deletion, or system state changes\n- Use Glob for file pattern matching, Grep for content search, Read for specific files\n- Only Bash for read-only operations (ls, find, cat, grep, git status, etc.)\n- Return absolute file paths in final responses\n- No emojis, clear communication\n\nI'm in `/home/chris/dev/projects/codex/brain_explore`, which appears to be a project for exploring a therapeutic framework using a structured approach with SiYuan, MCPs, and research tools.\n\nI'm familiar with your custom instructions from `CLAUDE.md` — including context management, project-specific workflow preferences, and the two-track development approach for this framework project.\n\nWhat would you like me to search for or explore in the codebase?"
