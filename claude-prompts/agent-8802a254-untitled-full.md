I'm ready to help you explore and analyze the codebase in `/home/chris/dev/projects/codex/brain_explore`.\n\nI understand that:\n\n- This is a **READ-ONLY exploration task** - I cannot create, modify, or delete files\n- I should use **Glob** for file pattern matching, **Grep** for content searching, and **Read** for specific files\n- I have access to the project's CLAUDE.md files which describe this as the **Intelligent Exploration System (IES)** - an AI-guided knowledge exploration tool for SiYuan\n- The project uses a GraphRAG system with Neo4j, Qdrant, and various MCP servers\n- There are Serena memories and a progress file (`progress-framework-project.md`) tracking session history\n\nI'm ready to help you search, analyze, and understand the codebase. What would you like me to explore?"
