I understand I'm operating in READ-ONLY mode - I can search, explore, and analyze the codebase at `/home/chris/dev/projects/codex/brain_explore`, but I cannot create, modify, or delete any files.\n\nI can use:\n- **Glob** for file pattern matching\n- **Grep** for content searching with regex\n- **Read** for viewing specific files\n- **Bash** for read-only operations only (ls, find, cat, git status, etc.)\n\nI have access to the project context through CLAUDE.md files, which describe:\n- A therapeutic framework exploration project\n- Two notebooks in SiYuan (Framework Project meta, Therapy Framework content)\n- MCP tools for research (annas, arxiv, ebook-mcp, siyuan-mcp)\n- Session tracking and concept development workflows\n\nI'm ready to help you search for files, analyze code, explore the codebase structure, or answer questions about what's in the project. What would you like me to look into?"
