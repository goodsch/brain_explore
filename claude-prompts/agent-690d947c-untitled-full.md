The real work is conceptual. Don't let building block doing.\n\n**Session Protocol:**\n1. **Re-entry** (2 min): Read last session log, orient\n2. **Focus**: Set intention — what question/area today?\n3. **Work**: AI-assisted exploration (questioning, research, synthesis)\n4. **Capture** (10 min): Create/update concepts in SiYuan, write session log\n\n### Track 2: Build Engaging Interface (Parallel)\nCustom web interface with visual feedback, varied interaction types, direct MCP integration.\n\n**Why:** ADHD needs engagement. Plain chat may not sustain.\n\n**Phases:**\n- Week 1: Core conversation + SiYuan read/write\n- Week 2: Visual map panel (React Flow or similar)\n- Week 3: Mode switcher, progress dashboard, re-entry support\n- Week 4+: Iterate based on use\n\n## SiYuan Structure\n\n### Two Notebooks\n\n**Notebook 1: \"Framework Project\"** (Meta/Planning)\n```\n/Framework Project/\n├── Dashboard/              # Current status, what's next\n├── Decisions/              # Key choices made (with rationale)\n├── Architecture/           # System design docs, MCP configs\n├── Sessions/               # Work session logs\n├── Backlog/                # Ideas, enhancements, future work\n└── References/             # Links to tools, docs, resources\n```\n\n**Notebook 2: \"Therapy Framework\"** (Content)\n```\n/Therapy Framework/\n├── 1-Human Mind/           # Track 1 concepts\n├── 2-Change Process/       # Track 2 concepts\n├── 3-Method/               # Track 3 concepts\n├── _Inbox/                 # Quick capture, unsorted\n└── _Maps/                  # Visual diagrams\n```\n\n## Templates\n\n### Concept Template\n```markdown\n# [Concept Name]\n\n**Track:** 1 / 2 / 3\n**Status:** seed / developing / solid\n\n## Core Statement\n[1-3 sentences — what this concept IS]\n\n## Why I Believe This\n[Personal experience, clinical observation, intuition, evidence]\n\n## Open Questions\n- [What's still unclear?]\n- [What challenges this?]\n\n## Related Concepts\n- [[Link to related concept]]\n```\n\n### Session Log Template\n```markdown\n# Session: [Date]\n\n## Starting Point\n[What question or area?]\n\n## Key Insights\n- [What emerged?]\n\n## Concepts Updated\n- [[Concept 1]] — [what changed]\n- [[Concept 2]] — [what changed]\n\n## Next Session\n[Where to pick up]\n```\n\n## AI Facilitation Modes\n\n### Mode 1: Socratic Exploration\n**When:** Vague intuition needs articulation\n**Behavior:** One question at a time, mirror back, surface assumptions, test consistency\n**Example prompt:** \"I have a sense that... but I can't quite articulate it\"\n\n### Mode 2: Structured Prompts\n**When:** Defining something specific (principle, mechanism, stage)\n**Behavior:** Present template questions, fill as answered, flag gaps\n**Example prompt:** \"I want to define [specific concept]\"\n\n### Mode 3: Research Integration\n**When:** Grounding in literature\n**Behavior:** Full research pipeline (discovery → synthesis → storage)\n**Example prompt:** \"What does the research say about...?\"\n\n### Mode 4: Challenge/Critique\n**When:** Stress-testing an idea\n**Behavior:** Devil's advocate, contradictory evidence, edge cases\n**Example prompt:** \"Poke holes in this idea\"\n\n## MCP Integration\n\n### Available Servers\n\n| MCP Server | Purpose | Key Operations |\n|------------|---------|----------------|\n| **annas** | Book discovery | `search(query)`, `download(book_id)` |\n| **ebook-mcp** | Content extraction | `get_toc()`, `get_chapter_markdown()` |\n| **siyuan-mcp** | Knowledge storage | `createDoc()`, `updateDoc()`, `search()` |\n\n### Research Pipeline\n```\nDiscovery → Acquisition → Extraction → Synthesis → Storage\n   ↓            ↓             ↓            ↓          ↓\n annas       annas       ebook-mcp      Claude    siyuan\n```\n\n## ADHD Considerations\n\n### Starting Support\n- Never blank page — always provide entry points\n- Dashboard shows \"where you left off\"\n- Quick-start options for common session types\n\n### Sustaining Support\n- Context preservation across sessions\n- Session logs as breadcrumbs\n- Visual progress indicators\n\n### Overwhelm Prevention\n- Manageable chunks only\n- One question at a time in Socratic mode\n- Clear \"pause points\"\n\n### Engagement Maintenance\n- Visual feedback (map growing, concepts connecting)\n- Varied interaction types (not just text)\n- Celebration of progress\n\n## Next Actions\n\n### Immediate (Today)\n1. Create SiYuan notebooks with structure\n2. Run first exploration session using existing tools\n3. Capture insights using concept template\n\n### This Week\n1. Start web interface scaffold (if energy permits)\n2. 3-4 exploration sessions\n3. Refine templates based on actual use\n\n### Ongoing\n- Iterate on what works\n- Don't over-engineer\n- Prioritize thinking over building\n</result>\n\nNow I have a good understanding of the project. Let me also check the original brain dump document:\n\n<function_calls>\n<invoke name=\"Read\">\n<parameter name=\"file_path\">/home/chris/dev/projects/codex/brain_explore/Therapy approach development.md</parameter>\n</invoke>\n</function_calls>\n<result>\n# Therapy Approach Development\n\n## Core Context\n- Chris (therapist) wants to develop and articulate his therapeutic approach\n- Currently has many ideas but no unified structure\n- Inspired by therapists who have clear, articulated models\n- Goal: Self-understanding first, possibly sharing later\n\n## Key Themes Identified\n\n### 1. Holistic Framework\n- Integrates multiple domains: neurodivergence, nervous system, real-world systems\n- Sees standard frameworks as too narrow\n- Wants unified theory that encompasses complexity\n\n### 2. Development Challenges\n- \"Too many ideas, no structure\" — can't see whole picture\n- Never had process to examine own thinking\n- Perfectionism blocks sharing half-formed ideas\n- ADHD affects sustained focus on single project\n\n### 3. What Would Success Look Like\n- Clear principles articulated\n- Organized knowledge base\n- Can trace reasoning for clinical decisions\n- Can share with peers/supervisees\n\n## Initial Q&A Session\n\n**Q: What kind of therapist do you work with and what do they present with?**\nA: ADHD is probably the core demographic. But more broadly it's people who feel like something is wrong with them and not the world... people who have been pathologized. The thing I want to shift is that they're not broken and they can stop trying to fix themselves.\n\n**Q: If someone asked \"what's your therapeutic approach?\" what would you say?**\nA: I don't fully know. That's kind of the crux of this. There's integrative... relational... somatic awareness... parts work language. But I've never synthesized it. I want to know what MY theory is, not just borrowed pieces.\n\n**Q: What drew you to therapy work originally?**\nA: Being helped myself. Seeing how it could work. The relationship mattered enormously. Also frustrated by mental health system — wanted to do it better.\n\n**Q: You mentioned neurodivergence, nervous system, real-world systems. Say more?**\nA: Nervous system state affects everything — whether you can think clearly, relate well. Neurodivergence shapes how the nervous system developed and responds. And real-world systems (capitalism, family systems, social pressures) create demands that may not fit how a person is wired. Most approaches focus on one and ignore others.\n\n**Q: What would \"synthesized\" look like?**\nA: I'd know what I believe about: why humans suffer, how change happens, what my role is as therapist. And these would connect — one coherent framework, not fragments.\n\n## Potential Structure (Three Tracks)\n\n### Track 1: Human Mind Theory\nWhy humans are the way they are — the building blocks.\n- Neurodivergence\n- Nervous system\n- Real-world systems\n- How these interact\n\n### Track 2: Change Process Model\nHow therapy creates change — the mechanisms.\n- What actually shifts\n- Stages of change\n- What enables vs blocks\n- Role of relationship\n\n### Track 3: Therapist Method System\nHow Chris actually works — operational.\n- Assessment approach\n- Intervention selection\n- Session structure\n- Therapeutic stance\n\n## Technical Considerations\n\n### Storage Options\n- SiYuan (local, already used, bi-directional links)\n- Obsidian (portable, plugin ecosystem)\n- Custom system (overkill for now)\n\n**Decision:** Use SiYuan — already familiar, has MCP integration\n\n### AI Assistance Needs\n- Questioning/exploration partner\n- Research integration\n- Structure suggestions\n- Session continuity\n\n### ADHD Accommodations\n- Context preservation between sessions\n- Not starting from scratch each time\n- Visual feedback and engagement\n- Low-friction capture\n\n## Unresolved Questions\n\n1. How to balance \"just start\" vs \"build proper system first\"?\n2. How much structure vs organic emergence?\n3. Should there be milestones/phases?\n4. How to handle when ideas contradict?\n5. What counts as \"done enough\" for a concept?\n\n## Session Notes\n\n### First Planning Session\n- Clarified the goal: self-understanding, examining own thinking\n- Identified three tracks as organizing principle\n- Decided on SiYuan for storage\n- Recognized ADHD considerations as critical\n- Next: Create concrete session protocol\n</result>\n\nI now have a complete picture of the **brain_explore** project. Here is a summary:\n\n---\n\n## Project Overview: brain_explore\n\n**Purpose:** A workspace for Chris (a therapist) to build a structured understanding of his therapeutic worldview, integrating neurodivergence, nervous system, and real-world systems perspectives.\n\n**Primary Goal:** Self-understanding - articulate and examine his own therapeutic approach and clinical instincts.\n\n**Core Problem Being Solved:**\n- Too many ideas, no structure\n- No process for examining own thinking  \n- Never synthesized a full picture of his approach\n\n---\n\n## Project Structure\n\nThe project currently consists of 4 documentation files:\n\n| File | Purpose |\n|------|---------|\n| `CLAUDE.md` | Main AI guidance document with full project context |\n| `AGENTS.md` | Quick state snapshot for AI orientation |\n| `Therapy approach development.md` | Original brain dump and Q&A from planning session |\n| `docs/plans/2025-11-29-therapy-framework-design.md` | Full design document |\n\n---\n\n## Three Content Tracks\n\n1. **Human Mind Theory** - Why humans are the way they are (neurodivergence, nervous system, real-world systems)\n2. **Change Process Model** - How therapy creates change\n3. **Therapist Method System** - Operational approach and tools\n\n---\n\n## Two-Track Development Approach\n\n1. **Start Working Now** - Use existing tools (Claude + SiYuan + MCP) to begin conceptual work immediately\n2. **Build Engaging Interface** - Custom web interface with visual feedback (parallel, ADHD-friendly)\n\n---\n\n## Technical Stack\n\n- **SiYuan** - Knowledge base storage (two notebooks: \"Framework Project\" for meta, \"Therapy Framework\" for content)\n- **MCP Servers** - annas (book search), ebook-mcp (content extraction), siyuan-mcp (knowledge storage)\n- **Planned Web Interface** - React Flow for visual maps, mode switching, progress dashboard\n\n---\n\n## Current State\n\n**Phase:** Initial Setup\n**Next Actions:**\n1. Set up SiYuan notebooks with defined structure\n2. Begin first exploration session\n3. Start web interface development (parallel track)\n\n---\n\n### Critical Files for Implementation\n\n- `/home/chris/dev/projects/codex/brain_explore/CLAUDE.md` - Primary project guidance and configuration\n- `/home/chris/dev/projects/codex/brain_explore/AGENTS.md` - State tracking for session continuity\n- `/home/chris/dev/projects/codex/brain_explore/docs/plans/2025-11-29-therapy-framework-design.md` - Full design specification with templates and modes\n- `/home/chris/dev/projects/codex/brain_explore/Therapy approach development.md` - Source material with Chris's therapeutic philosophy and goals"
