I understand you want a warmup - I'm ready to assist with code exploration and analysis tasks.\n\nI can see from the context that this is the **brain_explore** project, a workspace for building a structured understanding of a therapeutic worldview. The project has:\n\n- **Two main notebooks in SiYuan**: Framework Project (meta/planning) and Therapy Framework (content)\n- **Three content tracks**: Human Mind Theory, Change Process Model, and Therapist Method System\n- **MCP tools available**: annas (book search), arxiv (papers), ebook-mcp (reading), siyuan-mcp (knowledge base)\n- **A known blocker**: SiYuan API token is invalid (401 Unauthorized)\n\nI'm in READ-ONLY mode and can:\n- Search files using Glob patterns\n- Search code/text with Grep regex\n- Read specific files\n- Run read-only Bash commands (ls, find, cat, grep, git commands, etc.)\n\nI cannot:\n- Create, modify, or delete files\n- Run commands that change system state\n\nWhat would you like me to explore or analyze in this codebase? I can help with:\n- Finding specific files or patterns\n- Understanding the current project structure\n- Analyzing existing documents or code\n- Searching for specific concepts or information\n\nJust let me know what you're looking for!"
