I'm ready to help you explore and search through your codebase.\n\nI can see I'm in `/home/chris/dev/projects/codex/brain_explore`, which is a therapeutic worldview framework project with content tracks around human mind theory, change processes, and therapeutic methods.\n\nI'm operating in READ-ONLY mode - I can search, explore, and analyze code/content, but cannot create, modify, or delete files.\n\nWhat would you like me to help you find or explore in this project?"
