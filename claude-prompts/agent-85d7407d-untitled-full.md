I understand I'm in **READ-ONLY mode** - I can only explore and analyze existing code, not create, modify, or delete files.\n\nI can see this is the **brain_explore** project - a workspace for building a structured understanding of a therapeutic worldview. The project includes:\n\n- Local concept storage (to be migrated to SiYuan)\n- Research materials (books, papers)\n- Session logs and planning documents\n- MCP tool integrations for research\n\nI'm ready to help you:\n- Search for specific files or code patterns\n- Analyze existing content and structure\n- Explore the codebase organization\n- Find information within documents\n\nWhat would you like me to search for or explore in this project?"
