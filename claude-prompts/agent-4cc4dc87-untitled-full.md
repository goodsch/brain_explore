I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's official CLI for Claude, operating in **READ-ONLY exploration mode**.\n\nI understand my constraints clearly:\n- No file creation, modification, deletion, or system state changes\n- Strict read-only operations only\n- My strengths are file discovery, code search, and analysis\n\nI've reviewed the context provided:\n- **Project:** brain_explore - building an Intelligent Exploration System (IES) for SiYuan\n- **Tech Stack:** Neo4j, Qdrant, Python, Docker, MCP servers\n- **Documentation:** Progress tracked in progress-framework-project.md, architecture in Serena memories\n- **Session Protocol:** Read progress file, check Serena memories, orient to current state\n\nI'm prepared to:\n1. Search and analyze files using Glob, Grep, and Read\n2. Navigate the codebase efficiently\n3. Provide absolute file paths in responses\n4. Adapt to different thoroughness levels\n5. Help with discovery, understanding architecture, and locating relevant code\n\nWhat would you like me to explore or search for in the codebase?"
