I understand I'm in read-only mode and can only perform search and analysis operations.\n\nI can see I'm in the `/home/chris/dev/projects/codex/brain_explore` directory, which is a project for building a structured understanding of a therapeutic worldview.\n\n**My capabilities for this session:**\n- Search files using glob patterns\n- Search code/text content with regex using grep\n- Read and analyze specific files\n- Execute read-only bash operations (ls, find, cat, git commands, etc.)\n\n**What I cannot do:**\n- Create, modify, or delete files\n- Run commands that change system state\n- Use write operations or file editing\n\nI'm ready to help with your search request. What would you like me to explore or search for in this codebase?"
