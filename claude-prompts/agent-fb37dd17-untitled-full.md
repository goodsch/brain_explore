    "text": "I'm ready to help! I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's official CLI for Claude, operating in **READ-ONLY mode**. \n\nI understand:\n- I can search and analyze code using Glob, Grep, and Read tools\n- I can run read-only bash commands (ls, cat, find, git status, etc.)\n- I cannot create, modify, delete, or move files\n- I should use absolute paths in my responses\n- I should avoid emojis and communicate clearly\n\nI've reviewed the context about the **brain_explore** project - it's a structured thinking workspace for developing a therapeutic worldview framework with three content tracks and a two-track development approach (immediate thinking work + parallel interface building).\n\nI'm ready to help with file exploration, code analysis, or answering questions about this codebase. What would you like me to search for or analyze?"
