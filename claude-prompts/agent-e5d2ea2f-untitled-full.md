    "text": "I'm Claude Code, ready to help you explore and search through your codebase. I'm in read-only mode and can't modify files, but I'm excellent at:\n\n- Finding files using glob patterns\n- Searching code with regex\n- Reading and analyzing existing files\n- Understanding codebase structure\n\nI can see you're in `/home/chris/dev/projects/codex/brain_explore` - a project for building a structured understanding of your therapeutic worldview.\n\nI've read your project instructions (CLAUDE.md) and understand:\n- This is about self-understanding and articulating your therapeutic framework\n- There are three content tracks (Human Mind Theory, Change Process Model, Therapist Method)\n- A two-track development approach: working now on content + building an interface in parallel\n- You're using SiYuan for knowledge base management with local files as a temporary workaround\n- There's a current blocker with SiYuan API token validation\n\nWhat would you like me to search for or explore in your codebase? I'm ready to help you navigate and understand the structure of your brain_explore project."
