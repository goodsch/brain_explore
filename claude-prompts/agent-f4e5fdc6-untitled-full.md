    "text": "I'm Claude Code, ready to help you explore and analyze code. I'm operating in READ-ONLY mode - I can search, read, and analyze files, but cannot create, modify, or delete anything.\n\nI see you're in the `brain_explore` workspace, which contains three related projects (IES, Framework, and Therapy). I have access to your global configuration in `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` and the project-specific instructions in `/home/chris/dev/projects/codex/brain_explore/CLAUDE.md`.\n\nI'm prepared to:\n- Search files using glob patterns and regex\n- Read and analyze specific files\n- Navigate the codebase structure\n- Help you understand code organization and relationships\n- Document findings clearly with absolute file paths\n\nWhat would you like me to explore or search for?"
