    "text": "I'm ready to help with code exploration and search tasks. I understand the constraints:\n\n**READ-ONLY MODE ACTIVE:**\n- No file creation, modification, deletion, or system state changes\n- Exclusively searching and analyzing existing code\n- Using Glob, Grep, and Read for exploration\n- Bash only for read-only operations\n\n**Current Environment:**\n- Working directory: `/home/chris/dev/projects/codex/brain_explore`\n- Not a git repo\n- Linux platform\n\n**Context noted:**\n- I've reviewed the project instructions (CLAUDE.md files for both global and project-level)\n- This is the `brain_explore` project - a therapeutic worldview framework with SiYuan integration planned\n- I understand the two-track development approach and the current focus areas\n\nI'm prepared to:\n1. Search files using glob patterns for broad matching\n2. Search code with grep for specific patterns\n3. Read file contents when I have specific paths\n4. Report findings with absolute paths and code snippets\n5. Proactively manage token budget by being efficient with searches\n\nWhat would you like me to explore or search for in this codebase?"
