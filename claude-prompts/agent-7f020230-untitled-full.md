    "text": "I'm Claude Code, ready to help you explore and analyze your codebase. I've reviewed the project context for **brain_explore** — a workspace for building a structured understanding of your therapeutic worldview.\n\nI understand:\n\n- **Project Goal**: Self-understanding through articulating your therapeutic worldview across three tracks (Human Mind Theory, Change Process Model, Therapist Method System)\n- **Current Setup**: Local file structure (concepts, maps, sessions, research) until SiYuan API token is fixed\n- **Development Approach**: Two parallel tracks — immediate thinking work + building an engaging interface\n- **Key Blocker**: SiYuan API token needs updating (currently returning 401 Unauthorized)\n\nI'm in **READ-ONLY mode** and will use my strengths to:\n- Find files using glob patterns and search\n- Analyze code and documentation with regex\n- Read and examine file contents\n- Navigate your codebase structure\n\nWhat would you like me to explore or search for in your brain_explore project?"
