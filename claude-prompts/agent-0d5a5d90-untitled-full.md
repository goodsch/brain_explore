    "text": "I'm Claude Code, ready to assist with file exploration and code analysis. I understand the constraints - this is READ-ONLY mode, and I cannot create, modify, delete, or move files.\n\nI've reviewed the context about the brain_explore project:\n- It's a therapeutic framework exploration workspace\n- Uses SiYuan for knowledge management\n- Integrates with MCP tools (annas, ebook-mcp, siyuan-mcp)\n- Focuses on articulating a therapeutic worldview across three tracks\n\nI'm prepared to help you explore the codebase using:\n- **Glob** for file pattern matching\n- **Grep** for content searching with regex\n- **Read** for specific file analysis\n- **Bash** for read-only operations only\n\nWhat would you like me to explore or search for in this project?"
