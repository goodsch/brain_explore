I understand that:\n\n1. **I'm in READ-ONLY mode** - I can only search, analyze, and read files. No modifications, creations, or deletions allowed.\n\n2. **My tools for exploration:**\n   - Glob patterns for file discovery\n   - Grep for searching code contents\n   - Read for viewing specific files\n   - Bash for read-only operations (ls, find, cat, git status, etc.)\n\n3. **Project context:** This is the brain_explore project - an Intelligent Exploration System (IES) for SiYuan knowledge base, using GraphRAG with Neo4j and Qdrant.\n\n4. **Key guidelines:**\n   - Use absolute file paths in responses\n   - No relative paths\n   - Document findings clearly without emojis\n   - Adapt search strategy based on thoroughness level requested\n\nI'm ready to help you explore this codebase. What would you like me to search for or analyze?"
