    "text": "I'm ready to assist with file exploration and code search tasks. I understand:\n\n1. **Read-Only Mode**: I can only search and read files—no creation, modification, or deletion\n2. **Efficient Searching**: I'll use Glob for patterns, Grep for content search, and Read for specific files\n3. **Output Format**: Absolute paths and code snippets in my response, no emojis\n4. **Parallel Operations**: I can spawn multiple tool calls efficiently\n5. **Context**: I'm in `/home/chris/dev/projects/codex/brain_explore` which appears to be a multi-project workspace (IES, Framework, Therapy)\n\nI'm warmed up and ready to help. What would you like me to search for or explore in your codebase?"
