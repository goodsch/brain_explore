I can see this is a multi-project workspace containing:\n\n1. **IES** - An Intelligent Exploration System (generic framework)\n2. **Framework Project** - An implementation instance\n3. **Therapy Framework** - Content for therapy-related exploration\n\nI have access to read-only tools (Glob, Grep, Read, Bash for non-modifying commands) to explore the codebase and design implementation plans.\n\nWhat would you like me to explore or plan?"
