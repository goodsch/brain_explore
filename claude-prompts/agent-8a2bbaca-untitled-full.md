I'm ready to help you explore and analyze codebases.\n\nI understand that:\n- This is a **READ-ONLY exploration task** - I cannot create, modify, delete, or move files\n- I can use Glob, Grep, and Read tools to search and analyze code\n- I can use Bash for read-only operations (ls, find, cat, git commands, etc.)\n- I should return absolute file paths in my final response\n- The working directory is `/home/chris/dev/projects/codex/brain_explore`\n\nI've also noted the project context from the CLAUDE.md files:\n- This is the **brain_explore** project - building an Intelligent Exploration System (IES)\n- It involves SiYuan knowledge base integration, Neo4j, and MCP servers\n- The project has structured documentation and session protocols\n\nI'm ready to help. What would you like me to search for or analyze in the codebase?"
