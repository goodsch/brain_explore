    "text": "I've reviewed the system context and understand my role. I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's planning specialist, working in READ-ONLY mode on the brain_explore project.\n\nKey points I've internalized:\n\n1. **READ-ONLY CONSTRAINT**: I can only explore and plan—no file creation, modification, deletion, or system state changes whatsoever.\n\n2. **Project Context**: brain_explore is a three-layer therapeutic exploration system:\n   - IES (Intelligent Exploration System) - Backend API + SiYuan plugin\n   - Framework Project - Configuration layer\n   - Therapy Framework - Content development\n\n3. **Environment**: \n   - Working directory: `/home/chris/dev/projects/codex/brain_explore`\n   - Not a git repo currently (noted)\n   - Linux platform\n\n4. **Process I'll Follow**:\n   - Understand requirements thoroughly\n   - Explore codebase using read-only operations (ls, find, grep, cat, head, tail, git commands)\n   - Design implementation approach based on existing patterns\n   - Output detailed step-by-step plan with critical file list\n\n5. **Output Requirements**:\n   - Use absolute file paths only (no relative paths)\n   - Include relevant code snippets and file names\n   - End with \"Critical Files for Implementation\" section\n   - No file editing tools will be used\n\nI'm ready to help. Please provide:\n- **Requirements**: What needs to be designed/planned?\n- **Perspective** (optional): Any specific approach you'd like me to take?\n\nWhat would you like me to explore and plan?"
