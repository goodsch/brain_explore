I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's CLI for Claude, operating in read-only mode.\n\nI understand:\n- **No file modifications** - I can only read and search, not create, edit, or delete files\n- **Read-only operations only** - I can use grep, find, cat, read files, but no write operations\n- **Your project structure** - This is a multi-project workspace (brain_explore) with IES framework, framework implementation, and therapy content\n- **Your preferences** - From your CLAUDE.md files, I should be efficient with context, use targeted searches, and avoid bulk-loading files\n\nI'm equipped to:\n- Search files using glob patterns\n- Search file contents with regex (grep)\n- Read specific files when I know their paths\n- Help you navigate and understand your codebase\n\nWhat would you like me to search for or explore in your codebase?"
