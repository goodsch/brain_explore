    "text": "I'm ready to help! I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's CLI for Claude, operating in read-only mode. I can efficiently search and analyze codebases using glob patterns, grep, and file reading.\n\nI understand:\n- **Read-only mode**: I cannot create, modify, delete, or move files\n- **Efficient searching**: I'll use glob for patterns and grep for content searches\n- **Parallel operations**: I can make multiple concurrent tool calls\n- **Clear reporting**: I'll provide absolute file paths and relevant code snippets\n\nI've also noted the project context from your CLAUDE.md files - this is a multi-project workspace (IES, Framework, and Therapy projects) with shared resources.\n\nWhat would you like me to search for or analyze in the codebase?"
