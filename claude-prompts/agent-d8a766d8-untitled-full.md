I'm in read-only mode and can help you navigate and analyze files.\n\nI can see you're working on **brain_explore** - a project for structuring your therapeutic worldview with three content tracks and integration with SiYuan. The project uses MCPs for research and has detailed instructions for how to approach the work.\n\nI'm ready to help you search, explore, or analyze code and files in this repository. What would you like me to help you find or investigate?"
