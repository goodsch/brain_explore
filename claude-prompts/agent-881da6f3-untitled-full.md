Research has confirmed that Socratic questioning provides students with positive support in enhancing critical thinking skills (Chew, Lin, & Chen, 2019). In therapy, Socratic questioning helps clients examine their beliefs and thought patterns, leading to greater self-awareness and personal growth.\nRaw Content: [Meaning & Values](https://positivepsychology.com/category/meaning-values/ \"Meaning & Values\")\n\n16 Jul 2025\n\n [15](#comment-list)\n\n# Socratic Questioning in Psychology: Examples and Techniques\n\n**19 Jun 2020** by  **[Jeremy Sutton, Ph.D.](https://positivepsychology.com/team/jeremy-sutton/)**\n\nScientifically reviewed by  **[Maike Neuhaus Ph.D.](https://positivepsychology.com/team/maike-neuhaus/)**\n\n### Key Insights\n\n13 minute read\n\n* Socratic questioning is a technique used to challenge & deepen understanding by asking thoughtful, open-ended questions.\n* This method helps uncover underlying assumptions, clarify thoughts & foster critical thinking & self-reflection.\n* Applying Socratic questioning in therapy or conversation can lead to greater personal insight & problem-solving skills.\n\nThe philosopher Socrates is something of an enigma.\n\nCondemned to death in 399 BC and leaving no written works, we rely extensively on the writings of his pupil, philosophical heavyweight Plato (Honderich, 2005).\n\nPerhaps Socrates’ most significant legacy is his contribution to the art of conversation, known as Socratic questioning. Rather than the teacher filling the mind of the student, both are responsible for pushing the dialogue forward and uncovering truths (Raphael & Monk, 2003).\n\nAnd yet, what could a 2500-year old approach to inquiry add to the toolkit of the teacher, psychotherapist, and coach?\n\nWell, it turns out, quite a lot.\n\nIn this article, we explore the definition of Socratic questioning and how we apply it in education, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, and coaching. We then identify techniques, examples of good questions, and exercises that promote better, more productive dialogue.\n\nBefore you read on, we thought you might like to [download our five positive psychology tools for free](https://pro.positivepsychology.com/wp-content/uploads/giveawaytools.pdf).

And yet, whether in education or therapy, vague, purposeless questions have a rather aimless quality, wasting time and failing to elicit useful information (Neenan, 2008).\n\nThe Socratic method, often described as the cornerstone of [Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)](https://positivepsychology.com/what-is-cbt-definition-meaning/), solves this inadequacy by asking a series of focused, open-ended questions that encourage reflection (Clark & Egan, 2015). By surfacing knowledge that was previously outside of our awareness, the technique produces insightful perspectives and helps identify positive actions.\n\n> “I know you won’t believe me, but the highest form of human excellence is to question oneself and others.”\n\nSocrates\n\nSocratic questioning involves a disciplined and thoughtful dialogue between two or more people. It is widely used in teaching and counseling to expose and unravel deeply held values and beliefs that frame and support what we think and say.\n\nBy using a series of focused yet open questions, we can unpack our beliefs and those of others.\n\nIn education, we can remove, albeit temporarily, the idea of the ‘sage on the stage.’ Instead, the teacher plays dumb, acting as though ignorant of the subject. The student, rather than remaining passive, actively helps push the dialogue forward.\n\nRather than teaching in the conventional sense, there is no lesson plan and often no pre-defined goal; the dialogue can take its path, remaining open ended between teacher and student.\n\nThe Socratic method is used in coaching, with, or without, a clear goal in mind, to probe our deepest thoughts. A *predetermined goal* is useful when there are time pressures but can leave the client feeling that the coach has their own agenda or nothing to learn from the discussion (Neenan, 2008).\n\nIn *guided discovery*, the absence of a clear goal leads to questions such as “*can you be made to feel inferior by someone else’s laughter?”* asked with genuine curiosity. Here, the coach gently encourages the client to look at the bigger picture and see other options for tackling an issue.\n\nUltimately, *both* approaches have the goal of changing minds. One is coach led, and the other is client led; the coach or therapist may need to move on a continuum between the two.\n\n## What Is Socratic Questioning in CBT and Therapy?\n\nSocratic questioning is critical to successful Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (Clark & Egan, 2015).\n\nIndeed, in CBT, where the focus is on modifying thinking to facilitate emotional and behavioral change, the technique is recognized as helping clients define problems, identify the impact of their beliefs and thoughts, and examine the meaning of events (Beck & Dozois, 2011).\n\nThe use of the Socratic method by CBT therapists helps clients become aware of and modify processes that perpetuate their difficulties. The subsequent shift in perspective and the accompanying reevaluation of information and thoughts can be hugely beneficial.\n\nIt replaces the didactic, or teaching-based, approach and promotes the value of reflective questioning. Indeed, several controlled trials have demonstrated its effectiveness in dealing with a wide variety of psychological disorders.\n\nWhile there is no universally accepted definition of the Socratic method in CBT, it can be seen as an umbrella term for using questioning to “*clarify meaning, elicit emotion and consequences, as well as to gradually create insight or explore alternative action*” (James, Morse, & Howarth, 2010).\n\nIt is important to note that the approach, when used in CBT, must remain non-confrontational and instead guide discovery, in an open, interested manner, leading to enlightenment and insight (Clark & Egan, 2015).\n\nYou will find that Socratic questions usually have the following attributes (modified from Neenan, 2008):\n\n| Attributes of Socratic questions | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| Concise, directed, and clear | The attention remains on the client and should avoid jargon and reduce confusion. |\n| Open, yet with purpose | The client is invited to actively engage, with a clear rationale behind each question. |\n| Focused but tentative | The focus is on the issue under discussion, yet does not assume the client has the answer. |\n| Neutral | The questioning does not suggest there is a correct or preferred answer. |\n\nAbove all else, it is essential to remember that Socratic questioning should be confusion-free.\n\n## Download 5 Free Positive Psychology Tools\n\nStart thriving today with 5 free tools grounded in the science of positive psychology.\n\nDownload Tools\n\n## How to Do Socratic Questioning\n\nA fruitful dialogue using Socratic questioning is a shared one, between teachers and students or therapists and clients.\n\nEach participant must actively participate and take responsibility for moving the discussion forward.\n\nThe best environment, according to professor Rob Reich, is one of ‘productive discomfort,’ but in the absence of fear and panic (Reis, 2003).\n\nThere should be no opponents and no one playing ‘devil’s advocate’ or testing the other.\n\nInstead, it is best to remain open minded and prepared to both listen and learn.\n\n### Guidance\n\nSome guidance is suggested to perform Socratic questioning effectively.\n\n| Advice for the counselor or teacher |\n| --- |\n| Plan significant questions to inform an overall structure and direction without being too prescriptive. |\n| Allow time for the student or client to respond to the questions without feeling hurried. |\n| Stimulate the discussion with probing questions that follow the responses given. |\n| Invite elaboration and facilitate self-discovery through questioning. |\n| Keep the dialogue focused, specific, and clearly worded. |\n| Regularly summarize what has been said. |\n| Pose open questions rather than yes/no questions. |\n| Avoid or re-word questions that are vague, ambiguous, or beyond the level of the listener’s understanding. |\n\nFor a student or client, it is useful to understand what is expected.\n\n| Advice for the student |\n| --- |\n| Participate actively and thoughtfully. |\n| Answer clearly and succinctly. |\n| Address the whole class (where appropriate.) |\n\nTo be the ideal companion for Socratic questioning, you need to be genuinely curious, willing to take the time and energy to unpack beliefs, and able to logically and dispassionately review contradictions and inconsistencies.\n\n## 15 Examples of Socratic Questioning\n\nWhen used effectively, Socratic questioning is a compelling technique for exploring issues, ideas, emotions, and thoughts. It allows misconceptions to be addressed and analyzed at a deeper level than routine questioning.\n\nYou will need to use several types of questions to engage and elicit a detailed understanding.\n\n| Question type | Examples |\n| --- | --- |\n| Clarification | What do you mean when you say X?  Could you explain that point further? Can you provide an example? |\n| Challenging assumptions | Is there a different point of view?  What assumptions are we making here? Are you saying that… ? |\n| Evidence and reasoning | Can you provide an example that supports what you are saying?  Can we validate that evidence? Do we have all the information we need? |\n| Alternative viewpoints | Are there alternative viewpoints?  How could someone else respond, and why? |\n| Implications and consequences | How would this affect someone?  What are the long-term implications of this? |\n| Challenging the question | What do you think was important about that question?  What would have been a better question to ask? |\n\nStudents and clients should be encouraged to use the technique on themselves to extend and reinforce the effect of Socratic questioning and promote more profound levels of understanding.\n\n## World’s Largest Positive Psychology Resource\n\n*The Positive Psychology Toolkit©* is a groundbreaking practitioner resource containing over 500 science-based exercises, activities, interventions, questionnaires, and assessments created by experts using the latest positive psychology research.\n\nUpdated monthly. 100% science-based.\n\n*“The best positive psychology resource out there!”*   \n — Emiliya Zhivotovskaya, Flourishing Center CEO\n\n[Get Instant Access](https://pro.positivepsychology.com/sale-page/positive-psychology-toolkit/)\n\n## Using Socratic Questioning in Coaching\n\nCoaching is “*the art of facilitating the performance, learning, and development of another”* (Downey, 2003). To reach a deeper understanding of a client’s goals, [core values](https://positivepsychology.com/values-clarification/), and impediments to change, a coach must elicit information that is relevant, insightful, and ultimately valuable.\n\nAnd yet, not all questions are equally useful in coaching.\n\nVague or aimless questions are costly in terms of time and will erode the client’s confidence in the coaching process (Neenan, 2008).\n\nAsking open-ended questions helps clients reflect and generate knowledge of which they may have previously been unaware. Such insights result in clients reaching new or more balanced perspectives and identifying actions to overcome difficulties.\n\nCoaches should avoid becoming ‘stuck’ entirely in the Socratic mode. Complete reliance on Socratic questions will lead to robotic and predictable sessions. Indeed, at times, the therapist may require closed questions to push a point and offer some direction (Neenan, 2008).\n\n## Applications in the Classroom: 2 Examples\n\nSocratic questioning requires the student to identify and defend their position regarding their thoughts and beliefs.\n\nThe student is asked to account for themselves, rather than recite facts, including their motivations and bias upon which their views are based.\n\nDiscussion is less about facts or what others think about the facts, and more about what the student concludes about them. The underlying beliefs of each participant in the conversation are under review rather than abstract propositions.\n\nAnd according to science, it works very well. Research has confirmed that Socratic questioning provides students with positive support in enhancing critical thinking skills (Chew, Lin, & Chen, 2019).\n\n### 1. Socratic circles\n\nSocratic circles can be particularly useful for gaining an in-depth understanding of a specific text or examine the questioning technique itself and the abilities of the group using it:\n\n* Students are asked to read a chosen text or passage.\n* Guidance is given to analyze it and take notes.\n* Students are arranged in two circles – an inner one and an outer one.\n* The inner circle is told to read and discuss the text with one another for the next 10 minutes.\n* Meanwhile, the outer circle is told to remain silent and observe the inner circle’s discussion.\n* Once completed, the outer circle is given a further 10 minutes to evaluate the inner circle’s dialogue and provide feedback.\n* The inner circle listens and takes notes.\n* Later the roles of the inner and outer circles are reversed.\n\nObserving the Socratic method can provide a valuable opportunity to learn about the process of questioning.\n\n### 2. Socratic seminars\n\nSocratic seminars are the true embodiment of Socrates’ belief in the power of good questioning.\n\n* The teacher uses Socratic questions to engage discussion around a targeted learning goal, often a text that invites authentic inquiry.\n* Guidelines are provided to the students to agree to fair participation, including example questions and behaviors for thinking, interacting, and listening within the group.\n* Learning is promoted by encouraging critical analysis and reasoning to find deep answers to questions.\n* The teacher may define some initial open-ended questions but does not adopt the role of a leader.\n* Once over, a review of the techniques and the group’s effectiveness at using them should be performed and learnings fed into future seminars.\n\nIt takes time to learn and use the Socratic method effectively and should be considered a necessary part of the group’s overall journey.\n\nCBT demo socratic questioning - Qualia Counselling Services\n\n## 3 Helpful Techniques\n\n### 1. The five Ws\n\nAt times we all need pointers regarding the questions to ask. The misleadingly named  five Ws – who, what, when, where, why, and how – are widely used for basic information gathering, from journalism to policing.\n\n| Five Ws (and an H) |\n| --- |\n| Who is involved? |\n| What happened? |\n| When did it happen? |\n| Where did it happen? |\n| Why did it happen? |\n| How did it happen? |\n\nThe five Ws (and an H) provide a useful set of open questions, inviting the listener to answer and elaborate on the facts.\n\n### 2. Socratic method steps\n\nSimply stated, Socratic questioning follows the steps below.\n\n1. Understand the belief.  \n    Ask the person to state clearly their belief/argument.\n2. Sum up the person’s argument.  \n    Play back what they said to clarify your understanding of their position.\n3. Ask for evidence.  \n    Ask open questions to elicit further knowledge and uncover assumptions, misconceptions, inconsistencies, and contradictions.\n   * Upon what assumption is this belief based?\n   * What evidence is there to support this argument?\n4. Challenge their assumptions.  \n    If contradictions, inconsistencies, exceptions, or counterexamples are identified, then ask the person to either disregard the belief or restate it more precisely.\n5. Repeat the process again, if required.  \n    Until both parties accept the restated belief, the process is repeated.\n\nThe order may not always proceed as above. However, the steps provide an insight into how the questioning could proceed. Repeat the process to drill down into the core of an issue, thought, or belief.\n\n### 3. Best friend role-play\n\nAsk the client to talk to you as though they were discussing similar experiences to a friend (or someone else they care about.)\n\nPeople are often better at arguing against their negative thinking when they are talking to someone they care about.\n\nFor example, “*Your best friend tells you that they are upset by a difficult conversation or situation they find themselves in. What would you tell them? Talk to me as though I am that person*.”\n\n## 4 Exercises and Worksheets for Your Sessions\n\n### 1. Socratic question types\n\nThe Socratic method relies on a variety of question types to provide the most complete and correct information for exploring issues, ideas, emotions, and thoughts.\n\nUse a mixture of the following question types for the most successful engagement.\n\n| Questions regarding an initial question or issue | Answers |\n| --- | --- |\n| What is significant about this question? | | |\n| Is this a straightforward question to answer? | | |\n| Why do you think that? | | |\n| Are there any assumptions we can take from this question? | | |\n| Is there another important question that follows on from this one? | | |\n\n| Questions about assumptions | Answers |\n| --- | --- |\n| Why would someone assume that X? | | |\n| What are we assuming here? | | |\n| Is there a different assumption here? | | |\n| Are you saying that X? | | |\n\n| Questions of viewpoint | Answers |\n| --- | --- |\n| Are there alternative views? | | |\n| What might someone who thought X think? | | |\n| How would someone else respond, and why? | | |\n\n| Questions of clarification | Answers |\n| --- | --- |\n| What do you mean when you say X? | | |\n| Can you rephrase and explain that differently? | | |\n| What is the main issue here? | | |\n| Can you expand that point further? | | |\n\n| Questions of implication and consequence | Answers |\n| --- | --- |\n| Why do you think this is the case? | | |\n| Is there any other information needed? | | |\n| What led you to that belief? | | |\n| Are there any reasons to doubt the evidence? | | |\n\n| Questions of evidence and reasoning | Answers |\n| --- | --- |\n| Can you provide an example? | | |\n| Why do you think this is the case? | | |\n| Is there any other information needed? | | |\n| What led you to that belief? | | |\n| Are there any reasons to doubt the evidence? | | |\n\n| Questions regarding origin | Answers |\n| --- | --- |\n| Have you heard this somewhere? | | |\n| Have you always felt this way? | | |\n| What caused you to feel that way? | | |\n\n### 2.

The “modern” Socratic method is most often associated with teaching in the context of primary and secondary school, whereby the teacher has a curriculum or “knowledge agenda” and uses a series of probing and leading questions to draw out thoughts from the student in order to guide the student to the correct answer, or simply help him/her see things in a different light.\nRaw Content: [Skip to content](#main-content)\n\n# Smarter Thinking: The Socratic Method\n\n-8 Minute Read\n\nJust as the scientific method is one of the most prominent tools associated with science, the Socratic method is one of the foremost tools associated with critical thinking. *This article is part of the [Smarter Thinking Series](/topic/smarter-thinking?hsLang=en-au)**, which includes a range of mental models and tools to improve general decision making, business acumen, and critical thinking.*\n\n## Background\n\nThe technique is named after Socrates (469-399 BC), one of the most influential philosophers in history, who lived in ancient Athens, Greece. There are no known writings produced by Socrates. Most of what we know about his life comes from Plato, a student of Socrates, who wrote a series of “dialogues” featuring his teacher (although Socrates did not consider himself a “teacher” in the formal sense).  \n  \nAs told in Plato’s Apology, we learn that the Oracle of Delphi has confirmed to a friend of Socrates that no man is wiser than Socrates. Disturbed after hearing this news, Socrates sets out on a journey to understand how this could be, since he does not consider himself to be wise whatsoever. The philosopher travels around the city, seeking out respected Athenians — including politicians, poets, and artisans — who he suspects are wise about moral matters, such as the nature of virtue, courage, or justice. However, when the experts’ beliefs are cross-examined under his inquisitive, skilful, and persistent questioning style, he finds they are unwilling to admit that they do not really know what they suppose. What makes him wiser than others, Socrates concludes, is his willingness to acknowledge the true extent of his own ignorance. Socrates’ spate of dialogues eventually leads to him being charged with corrupting the minds of the youth and “impiety,” which famously results in Socrates committing suicide by drinking hemlock, despite having the apparent opportunity to escape his death sentence with the help of friends.  \n  \nEven though its roots are some 2,500 years old, and other problem solving, coaching, and questioning techniques have since arrived on the scene (e.g., Root Cause Analysis, 5 Whys, GROW, 6 Thinking Hats), the Socratic method still remains an extremely popular mental model. It is widely used by teachers, law professors, facilitators, consultants, coaches, and therapists.  \n  \nGregory Vlastos, one of the 20th century’s most influential scholars on ancient philosophy, regarded the Socratic method as among the greatest achievements of humanity.\n\n## Definition\n\nThe Socratic method is variously defined as a “pedagogical technique,” “a teaching style,” “a form of cooperative argumentative dialogue,” “a form of dialogic discussion,” “a form of inquiry and debate,” “a method of inquiry and instruction,” and “a disciplined form of questioning.” There is no “official” version of the method, universal definition, or universally accepted structure, framework, methodology, step-by-step process, or standardised set of questions.\n\n## Overview\n\nThe Socratic method is used in a variety of ways and with a variety of aims. In its loosest sense, the Socratic method has come to mean almost any teaching method involving question and answer, in contrast to teaching in the form of lecture (Scott, 2004). There is a long history of academic debate over whether Socrates really has a method, or whether he has a number of methods, and — if he only has one — what elements are most characteristic. Scholars and historians who have closely examined Plato’s dialogues see a wide range of discrepancies in how Socrates engages in conversation, and find it very difficult to regard Socrates as having any single uniform approach, even at a very broad level. The influential work of Gregory Vlastos advanced the idea that Socrates has a method, which Vlastos dubbed “the Socratic elenchus,” however this view has been disputed by many accounts.  \n  \nThe Socratic method, according to one prominent view, is a method of hypothesis elimination. The questioner is presented with an assertion or hypothesis by an interlocutor. The questioner proceeds to cross-examine the hypothesis by a persistent and targeted line of questioning, with a view to exposing a contradiction or weakness. If a weakness is discovered, the hypothesis may be eliminated. After discarding a faulty hypothesis, a new or reformulated hypothesis may be suggested, and the process repeated. The Socratic method, in this sense, is less a model for problem solving than it is a model for critical thinking, diagnostically probing intuitions, assumptions, or beliefs, and testing their validity. A considerate, non-judgmental, non-confrontational attitude is often seen as an important part of the process. Other key features of the method that have been proposed include an emphasis on intellectual humility, uncertainty, cooperation, curiosity, and shared learning. Socratic questioning is most often used between two or more people, but it may also be used on one’s own.\n\n## 3 Major Versions of the Socratic Method\n\nDepending on the context, the term “Socratic method” may refer to a style of questioning reminiscent of Socrates; reminiscent of a teaching mode commonly used in modern primary and secondary education; reminiscent of a teaching mode used by some U.S. law professors; or some combination thereof.\n\n### 1. “Classic” Method (Socrates)\n\nAlthough Socrates does not appear to have a consistent or unified method that is apparent throughout Plato’s writings, he would often start a dialogue by professing his ignorance on a philosophical subject (e.g., “What is courage?”) and request someone to propose true knowledge (e.g., “Courage is endurance of the soul”). Socrates would then reveal flaws in a given definition or claim, usually by providing a counterexample or competing definition, and — after inducing much confusion and perplexity (a mental state known to the Greeks as “aporia”) — people would be forced to confront their own ignorance.  \n  \nSome of the distinctive characteristics of the “classic” Socratic method are:\n\n* Uncertainty or “Aporia” (doubt, ambiguity, ignorance, or uncertainty is expressed or considered)\n* Moral Inquiry or “Ethics” (discussion is focused on moral matters i.e., how to live a good life)\n* Logical Refutation or “Elenchus” (beliefs, principles, or assumptions are cross-examined)\n\n### 2. “Modern” Method (Primary & Secondary Education)\n\nThe “modern” Socratic method is most often associated with teaching in the context of primary and secondary school, whereby the teacher has a curriculum or “knowledge agenda” and uses a series of probing and leading questions to draw out thoughts from the student in order to guide the student to the correct answer, or simply help him/her see things in a different light. The “modern” method is so named, not because it is recent in invention, but because of its prominence in modern education (Maxwell, 2015). Socrates’ “switch” to this method can be seen in the dialogue Meno, in which he helps a slave boy calculate the lengths and area of a square.  \n  \nSome of the distinctive characteristics of the “modern” Socratic method are:\n\n* Knowledge Agenda (the teacher usually has specific learning outcomes and withholds answers)\n* Guiding (the teacher seeks to build knowledge by guiding the student)\n* Developmental (the teacher is concerned with developing the student’s reasoning skills)\n\n### **3. “Socratic” Case Method (Legal Education)**\n\nThe “Socratic method” has been called a “defining element of American legal education.” According to a 1996 survey, the method was used by 97% of law professors with their first-year classes, although more recent accounts suggest a decline in its use and popularity. The term “Socratic method,” when it appears in the context of legal education, is not necessarily indicative of the descriptions given so far. Elements of Socratic teaching are often combined with the “case method” (as made famous by Harvard). Law students in many U.S. universities are required to read up on case summaries prior to attending class. Once in session, the professor may “cold call” (pick a student at random) and begin grilling the student on the details of the case, testing his/her responses from a number of angles. The intimidation, fear, and stress created through the use of this technique (like that seen in the 1973 film The Paper Chase) has been the subject of much criticism, and its emphasis on superficial fact checking rather than shared inquiry has led some to dispute whether this version of the method is truly “Socratic.”\n\n## Further Perspectives\n\n* Richmond et al. (2016) describe the Socratic method as being exemplified by 1) questioning knowledge, 2) evaluating knowledge, 3) having regard for self-generated knowledge, and 4) focusing on error to evoke doubt.\n* Paul and Elder (2007) identify at least two major purposes of Socratic questioning in teaching: 1) Helping students distinguish what they know from what they don’t, and 2) Helping students acquire Socratic tools to apply in everyday life\n* Boghossian (2012) identifies five steps in the Socratic approach: 1) Wonder, 2) Hypothesis, 3) Elenchus (refutation and cross-examination), 4) Acceptance/rejection of the hypothesis, and 5) Action.\n* Lam (2011) identifies four key steps in the Socratic method: 1) eliciting relevant preconceptions, 2) clarifying preconceptions, 3) testing one’s own hypotheses or encountered propositions, and 4) deciding whether to accept the hypotheses or propositions.\n* Cain (2007) identifies three main ways of using the method in Socrates’ philosophical discourse: 1) refutation, 2) truth-seeking, and 3) persuasion.\n* Peterson (2009) provides six Socratic elements that can be incorporated into the decision making process by a manager: 1) Ask an individual to provide instances or justifications for the position advocated, 2) Interject a counter-example in response, 3) Ask whether anyone in the group agrees with the position advocated, 4) Suggest a parallel example, 5) Illuminate a specific concept or position using an analogy, and 6) Play the role of devil’s advocate to an articulated position.\n\n## Socratic Method\n\nOne way of depicting the modern Socratic method is shown below.\n\nIn the diagram shown, the questioner initiates the Socratic method by attempting to elicit a clear hypothesis from the interlocutor. If a clear hypothesis is not produced, the questioner may attempt to rephrase the question, or offer a different suggestion. Once the interlocutor affirms a hypothesis, the questioner can begin examination. The questioner may seek to understand why the interlocutor made that decision; ask for evidence or reasoning to support the hypothesis; ask for thoughts on a counter example or a differing perspective, etc. After the initial examination, the interlocutor has a chance to respond (agree, disagree, clarify, elucidate, etc.) — or they may simply decide to revise their hypothesis. When a new hypothesis or a response is given, the questioner may again present further examination questions. The response stage can involve a lengthy question-and-answer exchange: the questioner may spend time probing different aspects of reasoning; guide the interlocutor towards an alternative view; the interlocutor may provide a counter response to the examination that the questioner is satisfied or unsatisfied with, etc. The entire dialogue may last a few seconds or several hours, depending on its aim, nature, and the participants' personalities, and may end with or without the interlocutor revising the hypothesis.\n\nNote: The model above is intended as general guide for understanding, and is not a strict prescriptive process.\n\n## Socratic Questions\n\nRichard Paul (1993) outlines six types of Socratic questions, which are often cited as a teaching resource.\n\n### **1. Clarification**\n\n* What do you mean by \\_\\_\\_?\n* Could you rephrase your point?\n* Why do you say that?\n\n### **2. Probing Assumptions**\n\n* What being assumed?\n* Is that assumption sound?\n* Could the assumption be different?\n\n### **3. Probing Reasons and Evidence**\n\n* How do you know?\n* What is the quality of the evidence?\n* Are there any reasons to doubt that?\n\n### **4. Viewpoints or Perspectives**\n\n* How might other people approach it?\n* What is an alternative view?\n* Have all the alternatives been considered?\n\n### **5. Implications and Consequences**\n\n* What is the result?\n* What does that imply?\n* If \\_\\_\\_ is true, how does it affect \\_\\_\\_ ?\n\n### **6. Questions About the Question**\n\n* Is answering this question useful?\n* Do we properly understand the question?\n* How could we resolve this question?\n\n*Adapted from Richard Paul, Critical Thinking: How to Prepare Students for a Rapidly Changing World, 1993.*   \n   \n\n## Benefits, Advantages and Strengths of the Socratic Method\n\nSome of the commonly cited benefits of the Socratic method include:   \n\n* Alternative to telling/selling/lecturing\n* Cooperative: Focused on dialogue rather than argument\n* Persuasive: a good technique to create doubt or “soften” a position, if not change it\n* Open, inclusive, and non-hierarchical\n* Does not require special qualifications, experience, or materials\n* Popular and generally well accepted pedagogical technique\n* Applicability: Can be incorporated into a wide range of fields, situations, and contexts\n* Flexibility: Approaches can be easily adapted/modified\n* Availability of literature, articles, and resources\n* Encourages critical thinking\n* Encourages intellectual humility\n* Encourages active mental engagement\n* The act of speaking/articulating an argument may reveal overlooked flaws\n* Potential argument flaws may be assessed in advanced, more often, and more deeply\n* Connects to an interesting story/important historical figure (i.e., Socrates)\n\n## Criticisms, Limitations and Weaknesses of the Socratic Method\n\nSome of the commonly cited criticisms of the Socratic method include:\n\n* Lack of empirical research / controlled studies\n* Absence of central authorship: No definitive conceptual framework\n* Proliferation of approaches and interpretations\n* Time consuming\n* Limited scope of content can be handled/covered\n* Cognitively focused rather than behavioural/experiential\n* Ineffective for skill transfer, especially complex/specialised (e.g., how to code, draw, swim)\n* Ease of use/popularity may lead to over-reliance and neglect of other techniques\n* Mentally demanding, especially for the interlocutor\n* Relies largely on the cognitive skills of the questioner to direct discussion and detect logical errors\n* No inherent structure to avoid reaching “false positive” or “false negative” conclusions\n* May be used dishonestly/unethically to seed doubt\n* “Downward” focus on definitions/evidence may ignore applications/broader relationships\n* May cause discomfort/stress for the interlocutor, especially in a large group setting\n* Inappropriate for very young children\n\n#### Topics:\n\n[Smarter Thinking](https://blog.hptbydts.com/topic/smarter-thinking)\n\n#### Don't forget to share this post!\n\n#### [Theo Winter](https://blog.hptbydts.com/author/theo-winter)\n\nClient Services Manager, Writer & Researcher.

He used this method to engage in philosophical discussions and promote self-examination. He is considered one of the most influential figures in the history of Western philosophy and is known for his contributions to ethics and epistemology, focusing on questions about morality, knowledge, and the nature of the self.\n\nHis method of philosophical inquiry, known as the Socratic method, involved asking probing questions to encourage critical thinking and self-examination. Socrates didn’t leave behind any written works; instead, his ideas and teachings were primarily transmitted through the writings of his students, particularly Plato.\n\n*I studied Plato at University, but I have to admit that I did not have the maturity to deeply understand the writings or delve into the profound nature of philosophy at that moment! Talk about the right time for things in our life… However, it did set me on the path of self-development and curiosity about some truly important questions in life as well as defining a clear code of ethics for myself.*\n\nSocrates’ commitment to seeking truth and wisdom, his emphasis on self-awareness and self-improvement, and his willingness to engage in philosophical dialogue even in the face of adversity have left a lasting legacy in the world of philosophy.\n\nSocratic questioning is often employed in various fields, including education, counselling, coaching, and problem-solving. Here are some key aspects of Socratic questioning:\n\n* **Open-Ended Questions:** Socratic questioning involves asking questions that cannot be answered with a simple “yes” or “no.” These questions encourage individuals to think deeply, reflect, and provide more elaborate responses. They encourage expanding our minds and the ideas we hold rigidly.\n* **Exploration of Assumptions:** Socratic questioning aims to uncover and challenge assumptions that individuals may hold about a topic or issue. By questioning these assumptions, it promotes a more critical and thoughtful examination of ideas. They make us explore concepts from different perspectives and points of view before arriving at a well-reasoned answer or potential answers.\n* **Clarity and Definition:** The process often begins by asking individuals to define key terms or concepts related to the topic under discussion. This helps ensure that everyone involved in the dialogue has a common understanding of the subject and avoids distractions or going off-theme.\n* **Examining Consequences:** Socratic questioning explores the potential consequences and implications of different viewpoints or decisions. It stimulates the process of thinking ahead and considering the long-term implications and consequences of their choices.\n* **Eliciting Evidence and Examples:** The kind of questions asked prompt individuals to provide evidence or examples to support their arguments or claims. This helps in evaluating the validity and reliability of their positions, inspiring them to expand their line of thought and accept fresh evidence. Often, we accept as truth our perception of a situation while many ‘truths’ of perception and viewpoint regarding it exist. Having many valid choices allows us to pick up the most empowering one for ourselves.\n* **Encouraging Self-Reflection:** Socratic questioning promotes self-reflection and introspection. It encourages individuals to examine their beliefs, values, and thought processes. It pushes us to go beyond our own self-imposed limits once we realize that we have them.\n* **Avoiding Leading or Directive Questions:** The goal of Socratic questioning is not to impose a particular viewpoint but to facilitate critical thinking and self-discovery. Therefore, by design it aims to be neutral and non-leading, allowing the individual to arrive at conclusions on their own. This is one of the most powerful ways of stepping into insights!\n* **Socratic Questioning and Empirical Research Design:** Empirical evidence refers to information gathered through direct observation, experimentation, or sensory experience. It involves collecting data, often quantifiable, to support or refute a hypothesis or claim. When designing empirical studies, researchers often use Socratic questioning to formulate research questions and hypotheses. By asking critical and exploratory questions, researchers can refine their focus and develop testable hypotheses.\n\nLet us have a good and practical look at how Socratic Questioning can be utilised to break through a very commonly held limiting belief:\n\n**Limiting Belief:** “I’m not good enough to succeed in my career.”\n\n***Clarification:*** “What specifically makes you believe that you’re not good enough for success in your career?”\n\n***Evidence:*** “Can you provide concrete examples or instances where you felt your abilities fell short in your career?”\n\n***Alternative Interpretations:*** “Could there be other reasons or explanations for those situations? What factors besides your abilities might have influenced the outcomes?”\n\n***Consequences:*** “How does holding onto this belief impact your career goals and decisions? What opportunities might you have missed because of it?”\n\n***Counterexamples:*** “Can you think of times when you did excel or made significant progress in your career? What did you do differently in those situations?”\n\n***Worst-Case Scenario:*** “If you were to challenge this belief and strive for success in your career, what’s the worst that could happen? How likely is that worst-case scenario?”\n\n***Best-Case Scenario:*** “On the flip side, if you believed in your abilities, what’s the best that could happen in your career? How might that change your actions and choices?”\n\n***External Perspectives:*** “Have you ever sought feedback from colleagues, mentors, or supervisors about your performance and potential in your career? What did they say?”\n\n***Reframing:*** “How might your perspective and actions change if you replaced the belief ‘I’m not good enough’ with a more empowering belief?”\n\n***Action Plan:*** “What specific steps or strategies can you implement to challenge this limiting belief and build more self-confidence in your career?”\n\nTry using Socratic questioning for your own beliefs. Through this process, you can gain a deeper understanding of the belief’s origins and its impact on your life, ultimately allowing you to make more informed decisions about how to address and potentially overcome it. If you need help in breaking through your limits, get in touch.\n\n*As a mindfulness practitioner and life-design coach, I help clients focus on well-being and personal growth and make life choices that prioritize their mental and emotional health. This leads to personal freedom and independence allowing the person to blossom and manifest the life they deserve.*\n\n[Socrates](https://medium.com/tag/socrates?source=post_page-----5eca1e2be9e8---------------------------------------)\n\n[Limiting

In Brief\n\nOdds are that you already have a variety of tools and techniques in your therapist’s toolkit. One such tool, rooted in ancient philosophy, has proven valuable over time and remains useful to help clients navigate their mental health journey.\n\nThis technique invites clients to explore their thoughts, beliefs, and assumptions, encouraging a deeper understanding of themselves and their experiences. It's also worth mentioning that it can be a great complement to other intervention exercises, take a look at the 200+ available in [Blueprint's library](https://clinician.blueprint.ai/onboarding?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=embeddedcta). Through guided self-reflection, clients can uncover insights and develop a more balanced perspective. Let’s take a look at Socratic questioning, its origins, purpose, and role in therapy, as well as practical examples and tips for using this technique in your practice.\n\n## **Introduction to Socratic Questioning**\n\n**‍**Socratic questioning involves asking a series of focused, open-ended questions to encourage critical thinking and self-reflection. Rooted in the philosophy of Socrates, therapists use this method to promote shifts in paradigms  and help clients gain insight into their thoughts, beliefs, and behaviors.\n\nTherapists use Socratic questioning to guide clients through self-exploration, helping them identify and investigate established thought patterns. Encouraging clients to examine assumptions and explore their beliefs in a nonjudgmental space allows therapists to assist them in developing skill in articulating their ideas clearly, exploring alternative perspectives, and have a deeper understanding of where their beliefs come from.\n\nSocratic questioning empowers clients to actively participate in their mental health journey. By fostering autonomy and self-awareness, this technique helps clients build resilience, improve problem-solving skills, and achieve lasting positive change.\n\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/66db3ea1a1faecd9f045cc92/678a0bb91804bb9b9bd504b7_678a0b64053a80ecd6dc5f66_GeneralDoc_01.png)\n\n## **Core Principles of Socratic Questioning**\n\n**‍**Socratic questioning involves a collaborative process that encourages open dialogue between the therapist and client. The therapist takes a curious, non-judgmental stance, inviting the client to explore their thoughts and beliefs in a safe, supportive environment. This approach builds a sense of partnership, as the therapist and client work together to uncover insights and solutions.\n\nIn Socratic questioning, the therapist guides the client through self-reflection, using questions to explore the client's perspective. Instead of imposing interpretations or opinions, the therapist assists the client in examining their own beliefs, assumptions, and thought patterns. This focus on the client's internal world empowers them to take charge of their mental health journey and develop a deeper understanding of themselves.\n\nKey principles of Socratic questioning include:\n\nThe goal of Socratic questioning is to guide clients toward self-awareness. By asking thought-provoking questions and encouraging clients to examine their beliefs, therapists help clients find their own insights, solutions, and inner resources. This process of self-awareness promotes personal growth, resilience, and a greater sense of control over one's mental well-being.\n\n## **The Therapeutic Benefits of Socratic Questioning**\n\n**‍**Socratic questioning offers many therapeutic benefits that support clients' personal growth and mental well-being. This technique plays an important role in helping clients identify and explore automatic thoughts and unhelpful assumptions underlying a negative belief. Through self-reflection, clients are guided to construct healthier narratives that align with evidence.\n\nUsing Socratic questioning encourages clients to take responsibility for their thoughts and behaviors. As they explore their beliefs and assumptions, clients gain a greater sense of control over their mental health journey. This increased self-efficacy motivates clients to actively participate in their therapy, fostering a sense of autonomy and self-determination.\n\nKey benefits of Socratic questioning include:\n\nSocratic questioning stands as an effective tool for promoting lasting change and empowering clients to take an active role in their mental health journey. As clients develop the skills to question their assumptions, consider alternative perspectives, and generate their own insights, they build resilience and self-efficacy, equipping them with the tools to handle life's challenges long after therapy has ended.\n\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/66db3ea1a1faecd9f045cc92/678a0bb91804bb9b9bd504d1_678a0b79053a80ecd6dc76c8_GeneralDoc_02.png)\n\n## **Types of Socratic Questions and Examples**\n\n**‍**Socratic questioning includes several types of questions designed to explore the client's thoughts, beliefs, and assumptions from various angles. These questions encourage self-reflection, critical thinking, and the consideration of different perspectives. Let's look at the main types of Socratic questions and their roles in therapy:\n\n## **Practical Applications of Socratic Questioning in Therapy**\n\n**‍**Let's look at how therapists can apply Socratic questioning in various clinical scenarios. These examples show how different types of questions can help clients gain insight, challenge distorted thinking, and develop healthier perspectives:\n\n**Example 1: A client with anxiety over a work presentation**\n\n**Example 2: A client with depression who engages in all-or-nothing thinking**\n\n**Example 3: A client with relationship difficulties**\n\n**Example 4: A client with** [**low self-esteem**](https://www.blueprint.ai/blog/a-therapists-essential-guide-to-scoring-and-interpreting-the-rosenberg-self-esteem-scale)\n\nWhen applying Socratic questioning, therapists must remain curious, empathetic, and non-judgmental. The goal is to guide clients through a process of self-awareness, helping them uncover their own insights and solutions. As clients learn to question their assumptions and consider alternative perspectives, they develop the skills necessary for lasting cognitive and behavioral change.\n\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/66db3ea1a1faecd9f045cc92/678a0bb91804bb9b9bd504c0_678a0b8b7d2f00307780a288_GeneralDoc_03.png)\n\n## **Common Challenges in Using Socratic Questioning and How to Navigate Them**\n\n**‍**While Socratic questioning serves as a valuable tool in therapy, therapists may encounter certain challenges when applying this technique. Overusing questions is one common pitfall, which can make the client feel interrogated or alienated, potentially harming the therapeutic relationship. Therapists need to balance asking thought-provoking questions with maintaining a supportive and collaborative atmosphere.\n\nTiming and readiness also play important roles when using Socratic questioning. Therapists should determine whether the client is emotionally prepared to engage in self-reflection and challenge their beliefs. In some cases, a more psychoeducational, supportive, or validating approach might be necessary before moving into deeper questioning.\n\nHandling resistance presents another challenge therapists may face when using Socratic questioning. Clients who are defensive or resistant to exploring their thoughts and beliefs may need a more gentle approach. Some strategies for managing resistance include:\n\nTherapists should remain patient, empathetic, respectful, and non-confrontational when working with resistant clients. Focusing on understanding the client's perspective, connecting with their reality, and maintaining a collaborative stance can help reduce defensiveness and foster a more productive therapeutic environment.\n\n## **Ethical Considerations and Cultural Sensitivity**\n\n**‍**Socratic questioning can be a very effective therapeutic tool, but it needs to be used with ethical considerations and cultural sensitivity in mind. Therapists have a responsibility to ensure their questioning does not feel manipulative or coercive to the client. This means being mindful of the client's emotional state, readiness for self-reflection, and personal boundaries. Pushing too hard or too quickly can damage the therapeutic relationship and hinder progress.\n\nRespecting client autonomy is another important ethical consideration when using Socratic questioning. While therapists may guide clients through self-exploration, they must ultimately respect the client's right to their own beliefs, values, and perspectives. Socratic questioning should not be used to impose the therapist's worldview or pressure clients into making decisions they are not comfortable with.\n\nCultural sensitivity also plays a vital role when applying Socratic questioning. Therapists must be aware of how cultural background can influence the way clients respond to certain types of questions. Some key considerations include:\n\nTo practice cultural sensitivity, therapists should engage in ongoing self-reflection and seek consultation and training about working with diverse cultures. This includes examining their own biases, assumptions, and cultural lens. When using Socratic questioning, therapists should remain open, curious, and respectful of clients' unique cultural contexts, adapting their approach as needed to ensure a collaborative and inclusive therapeutic process.\n\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/66db3ea1a1faecd9f045cc92/678a0bb91804bb9b9bd504c3_678a0ba641a91e41809dea55_GeneralDoc_04.png)\n\n## **Key Takeaways**\n\n**‍**Socratic questioning offers therapists a meaningful way to help clients gain deeper self-awareness, shift to more useful and mindful thinking patterns, and develop healthier perspectives. This technique encourages active participation in therapy, empowering clients to take charge of their mental health journey and fostering lasting positive change.\n\nKey benefits of Socratic questioning include:\n\nTo effectively use Socratic questioning in your practice, consider the following:\n\nSocratic questioning adds significant value to any therapist's toolkit, offering a powerful means to guide clients toward greater self-awareness, resilience, and personal growth.

Critiqued by some and vigorously defended by others, the Socratic method is a time-tested means of teaching critical thinking to law students throughout the United States.15 Given the importance of critical thinking in the legal profession, the use of the Socratic method in health care education appears both logical and sound. While further research is needed to evaluate the ability of various modalities to effectively teach and test critical thinking in health care education, the Socratic method, if used appropriately, is an attractive “lost art” among the teacher’s instructional supplies.\nRaw Content: An official website of the United States government\n\nHere's how you know\n\n**Official websites use .gov**   \n A **.gov** website belongs to an official government organization in the United States.\n\n**Secure .gov websites use HTTPS**   \n A **lock** (  ) or **https://** means you've safely connected to the .gov website.

This review provides an analysis examining why current methods of teaching critical thinking to health care students (primarily medical and pharmacy students) often fail and describes a premise and potential utility of the Socratic method as a tool to teach critical thinking in health care education.\n\n**Keywords:** critical thinking, Socratic method, pharmacy education\n\n## INTRODUCTION\n\nAs a result of increasing pressure from accrediting bodies and an evolving technical landscape, health care colleges and schools continue to place increasing emphasis on critical thinking skills rather than provision of facts and rote memorization.[1,2](#B1) Additionally, the incorporation of competency-based education requires that students develop a deeper understanding of course material, which in turn necessitates new modes of content delivery and incorporation of new thought processes. A number of varying modalities intended to instill critical thinking have been attempted; however, in most cases these attempts have been reported to be only partially effective and often inconsistent in yielding positive results. This review will discuss the value of critical thinking among health care professionals and will re-visit the use of the Socratic method or Socratic questioning as a tool for modeling critical thinking.\n\n## CRITICAL THINKING\n\nNumerous definitions of critical thinking have been described and reviewed elsewhere,[3](#B3) but the concept is understood to have originated through the teachings of the classic Athenian philosopher Socrates (469-399 BCE). Often regarded as a founder of Western philosophy, Socrates observed that his students often lost their ability to justify their own preconceived thoughts and beliefs after a series of specific, targeted questions.[4](#B4) Conversely, through appropriate and repeated questioning, Socrates observed that these same students eventually developed self-generated knowledge and the ability to regulate their own thoughts. *The Art of Socratic Questioning* describes 3 types of questions that, when used strategically by the questioner, can aid students in regulating their own thoughts. These questions are categorized as those of procedure, preference, and judgment.[5](#B5) Questions of procedure are defined as those with correct answers, such as “Which of the following medications is a beta-blocker?” Alternatively, questions of preference are those with no correct answers, such as “How do you prefer to conduct patient counseling?” It is in the third type of question, however, where the Socratic definition of critical thinking can be found, as these types of questions are those with “best” answers, such as, “What is the most appropriate antibiotic for this patient?” Therefore, critical thinking within a Socratic paradigm might be described as the application and analysis of information requiring clarity, logical consistency, and self-regulation.\n\nThe ability to think critically is not only expected by employers but also almost unilaterally prescribed by accrediting bodies.[6](#B6) The provision of high level care by pharmacists across all health care disciplines inherently requires the ability to think critically. As technology continues to make rote knowledge rapidly searchable, discoverable, and transferrable, the ability to think critically continues to gain importance. Tyreman states that all knowledge of suffering people is derived from two sources: previously treated patients with a similar disease course or changing medical knowledge.[7](#B7) Therefore, the ability to relate current patient events to previous ones, while appreciating the innate limitations of this practice, is paramount to thinking critically.\n\nIn the clinical setting, the ability to think critically requires both an understanding of the “deep structure” of a question and the ability of the practitioner to relate that structure to similar experiences from his or her past.[8](#B8) This “deep structure” refers to the question within the question (as opposed to its surface structure, which refers to the direct question at hand). For example, in a word problem using multiplication of rows and columns to count the number of vegetables in a garden, the deep structure relates to mathematics whereas the surface structure relates to farming, the latter of which is irrelevant to the problem’s solution. Chen et al. examined this construct in a 2004 study that evaluated 90 college students’ (60 American students’ and 30 Chinese students’) ability to propose a correct solution to each of two problems.[9](#B9) The first problem was very similar to the story of Hansel and Gretel, where the correct solution related to leaving a trail of items to avoid getting lost; the second was very similar to a common Chinese tale called “Weigh the Elephant,” where the correct solution related to using water displacement to weigh an object too large for a scale. Nearly 80% of the American students answered the Hansel and Gretel question correctly compared to 25% of Chinese students (*p*<0.05); for the elephant question, success rates were flipped, with 69% of Chinese students answering correctly compared to 8% of American students (*p*<0.05). The disparity in correct responses suggests that ability to recognize and understand a question’s deep structure is paramount to the ability to think critically and apply previously-learned information to new situations. This, in concert with the statements by Tyreman,[7](#B7) suggests that appropriate patient care requires the ability to critically analyze and apply information from previous patient cases and the available, albeit constantly changing, medical knowledge base.\n\nAn ability to think critically is also considered a foundational step in the development of expertise in a given content area or specialty. In his review, Tyreman analogizes being an expert versus a trainee to driving a car versus driving a motorcycle.[7](#B7) Despite being able to appropriately drive a car, the ability to drive a motorcycle is not innate; he concludes that an expert is one *who is*, as compared to a novice, who is one *who* (merely) *does.* He subsequently elaborates saying an expert can apply himself “across a range of familiar and unfamiliar situations” and assess the context of a problem. Without the ability to recognize the deep structure of a question and apply it to previous scenarios, it is unreasonable to believe practitioners will be able to develop the skills necessary to ‘think like an expert.’\n\nA common assumption is that health care ‘experts’ are inherently able to think more critically than their novice counterparts. Although the research presented below refutes this premise, the importance of critical thinking as an elemental skill of practitioners remains. In a 2004 study, Miller evaluated the ability of 66 pharmacy students to critically evaluate literature as an assessment of their ability to ‘think like experts.’[10](#B10) Students were given three distinct trial summaries (one “well-designed” experimental study, one “well-done” case-control study, and one “poorly-designed” experimental study). All 3 research papers evaluated the ability of beta-carotene to prevent cervical cancer, and each produced negative results. Students were asked to use a visual analog scale to rate their confidence from 0 to 100 in the ability of beta-carotene to prevent cervical cancer both at baseline and after reading each study in random order. The authors then calculated student “likelihood ratios” (ie, the odds of believing vs not believing after reading each study divided by the same odds before reading any study), which were then compared to those of experts given the same task. The author found likelihood ratios more strongly correlated with level of evidence in the expert group than the student group, suggesting students were not able to critically evaluate literature as efficiently. The study found no correlations between scores on the California Critical Thinking Skills Test (CCTST) and students’ abilities to “think like experts.” There was, however, a correlation between CCTST scores and students’ final grades in the broader literature evaluation course within which the trial was conducted (*r*=0.45, *p*<0.001). This suggests that thinking like an expert is not akin to thinking critically, despite the intuitive assumption that the systematic approach to literature evaluation and critical thinking require thought regulation. Encouragingly, it appears health care courses and course examinations can be designed to test critical thinking.\n\nThis study had a number of limitations. First, the authors did not report CCTST scores at baseline, which subsequently does not allow for an a priori assessment of the course’s ability to teach critical thinking. Second, CCTST scores were collected as part of a separate study and correlated with examinations in the course; this might suggest that the course was not designed to teach critical thinking. Third, the authors note that students may have purposely placed little weight on each of the three studies based on what they thought the course instructor expected on the final examination, which may explain a lack of correlation between CCTST scores and likelihood ratios. Finally, experts were not given the CCTST examination for comparison. Although this study did not support a correlation between critical thinking and literature evaluation, the aforementioned limitations decrease the validity of this conclusion. Further the application of information, as previously reviewed, likely requires higher-level critical thinking skills. To the knowledge of the authors, this has not been formally evaluated in pharmacy education.\n\nThe challenges involved with teaching critical thinking are not new. Since as early as the 1950s, education has faced the issue of teaching critical thinking to students, and, with few exceptions, educators have failed to consistently document successes.[11](#B11) Three key principles underlying critical thinking have been described for educators tasked with motivating students towards better thinking.[8](#B8) First, critical thinking is not simply a skill that can be learned. Second, critical thinking is more likely in those learners with certain metacognitive strategies in place (eg, the forethought to consistently look for the deep structure in a question). Finally, the ability to think critically relies to some extent on domain knowledge and practice. In other words, one must not only recognize the deep structure of a question, but also be able to relate it to prior experiences. It therefore follows that one cannot think critically about an issue in which they have no point of reference.\n\nDespite the noted difficulty in teaching critical thinking, a number of methods have been proposed to aid educators charged with teaching critical thinking to student health care professionals. Among other methods, these variations can include group learning, problem-based learning, case-based learning, writing and reflection, concept mapping, and experiential education ([Table 1](#T1)). A complete discussion of these methods is beyond the scope of this paper as other authors have previously compiled comprehensive reviews in this regard.[3](#B3) It should be noted, however, that few of the aforementioned methods focus on metacognition.\n\n### Table 1.\n\nExamples of Activities Used to Encourage Critical Thinking\n\n[Open in a new tab](table/T1/)\n\nUnfortunately, many studies evaluating the ability to teach critical thinking have failed to produce overwhelmingly positive, reproducible results. In an effort to measure critical thinking skills throughout a curriculum, Miller evaluated CCTST and California Critical Thinking Dispositions Inventory (CCTDI) scores annually for 5 cohorts of pharmacy students at North Dakota State University. At the conclusion of data collection, information from each year was available for the first 2 cohorts (graduating classes of 1997 and 1998, n=60 students each).[12](#B12) The study found a statistically significant increase in mean CCTST scores from professional year 1 through professional year 4 for each group (20.35 vs 18.15 for cohort 1, *p*=0.006; 21.71 vs 18.26 for cohort 2, *p*<0.001). However, it should also be noted that motivation to think critically, as assessed by the CCTDI decreased in both cohorts over the 4-year periods (mean composite score 307.7 vs. 303.8 for cohort 1, *p*=0.41; 305.8 vs. 300.4 for cohort 2, *p*=0.21), suggesting a decrease in inquisitiveness of pharmacy students as they progressed through the curriculum. Unfortunately, the author did not comment on specific attributes of the curriculum that could have caused the improvement in scores. Further, there was no comparison group, preventing analysis of whether changes in CCTST scores were attributable to the pharmacy curriculum or simply general maturation throughout matriculation. The authors also made note that students’ motivation to do well may have impacted results.\n\nIn another study conducted at Campbell University School of Pharmacy, Cisneros found no significant differences between critical thinking ability, as measured by the CCTST, both at the beginning and end of each professional year within a doctor of pharmacy degree program.[13](#B13) Although the study was not designed to detect differences between classes, mean CCTST composite scores were not different between first and fourth professional year students (20.0 vs. 20.4, *p*=0.79), suggesting overall critical thinking ability did not change throughout the pharmacy curriculum. The authors mention the contribution of a possible “ceiling effect,” stating that the overall high scores at baseline seen in pharmacy students limited the possible increase in critical thinking ability as assessed by the CCTST. Other potential reasons for discrepancies between this study and others reporting improvement in thinking scores include a small sample size, unfamiliarity with this type of research at the institution, and limited follow-up.\n\nTiwari and colleagues compared problem-based learning (PBL) to traditional lectures in regard to their respective abilities to stimulate critical thinking in a cohort of 79 first-year undergraduate nursing students.[14](#B14) Despite similar baseline mean composite scores on the CCTDI exam, t"

These are considered the four core skills (Miller & Rollnick, 2013).\n\n### Open questions\n\n*Open questions* are designed to encourage clients to tell their story in their own words. They enable you to explore, clarify, and gain an insight into your client’s world and demonstrate curiosity and interest in the person. Importantly, using open questions can prompt a discussion about the reasons for making changes.\n\nExamples of open questions and inquiring statements include:\n\n* Help me understand…\n* How would you like things to be different?\n* What do you want to do next?\n* Tell me more about…\n\n### Affirmations\n\nMiller and Rollnick (2013) identify *affirmation* as a key element of motivational interviewing and building and maintaining a therapeutic relationship with the client. The use of affirmations identifies clients’ strengths and acknowledges the client’s efforts in their struggles.\n\nPersonal affirmations are important supportive statements to help clients increase their confidence in their ability to change. Affirmations are statements of appreciation and understanding.\n\nThese statements are intended to make the client feel supported by the practitioner, regardless of the status of their behavioral changes or attempts to change, and play an important role in building the therapeutic alliance. However, affirmations must be genuine for them to truly resonate with a client. One way to ensure authenticity is to focus on specific positive behaviors and acknowledge small successes.\n\n### Reflective listening\n\n*Reflective listening* is a primary skill used in MI to demonstrate empathy, interest, and understanding. Reflective listening involves the therapist hearing and understanding and then letting the client know that they are being heard and understood.\n\nIn relation to encouraging behavior change, reflective listening helps to clarify and explore reasons for change. In reflective listening, you do not offer your perspective but, instead, keep the focus directly on what your client is saying.\n\nAlthough the primary focus is on what the client actually says, the therapist can also reflect what they notice in tone of voice, body language, and sometimes by noticing what is not said or gaps in the narrative.\n\nReflective listening can be viewed as a “checking” process to ensure that both client and therapist understand what is being communicated.\n\n### Summary reflections\n\nSummarizing in MI is an application of reflective listening and should be used throughout the session. As with reflective listening, summaries can be a good way to check that you have thoroughly understood your client. Summarizing can be a particularly useful technique to assist a client in organizing their experience.\n\nFor the most part, therapists should aim to summarize elements that will help the client move forward. Nonetheless, suppose a client is ambivalent about change. In that case, it is important to reflect this authentically by including both sides in the summary (for example, saying something like, “on the one hand xx, but on the other hand xx”).\n\n## 10 Strategies for Eliciting Change Talk\n\nMiller and Rollnick (2013, p. 159) define change talk as “any self-expressed language that is an argument for change.”\n\nEliciting change talk is an essential, active ingredient of MI (Miller & Rollnick, 2013), and it has been shown to predict improved outcomes in therapy (Walker, Stephens, Rowland, & Roffman, 2011).\n\nOne of the most critical tasks for therapists is to recognize change talk when it occurs. Miller and Rollnick (2013) use the acronym DARN CAT to describe various types of change talk:\n\n* Desire\n* Ability\n* Reasons\n* Needs\n* Commitment language\n* Action (current movement)\n* Taking steps toward change\n\nSo what techniques or strategies can you utilize to encourage your client to express and explore change talk? We have identified 10 strategies you might like to employ in your MI work.\n\n1. Ask evocative questions:  \n    Ask open questions that have an emphasis on change (for example, “How would you like things to be different?”)\n2. The ruler strategy:  \n    One of the most commonly used methods to elicit change talk through MI is the 0–10 ruler strategy (Resnicow, Gobat, & Naar, 2015). This usually takes the form of two questions:\n   1. On a scale from zero to ten, how important is it for you to (change), where zero is not at all important, and ten is extremely important?\n   2. On a scale from zero to ten, how confident are you that you could (change)?\n\n   On obtaining a rating, the therapist can prompt further exploration by asking why the client did not choose a higher/lower number and what it would take to alter the number.\n3. Explore costs and benefits:  \n    Explore both the costs and benefits of maintaining the current situation and then the costs and benefits of change. This can be done in the form of writing a list together to discuss further.\n4. Ask the client to elaborate:  \n    When you hear change talk, ask the client to provide more details (for example, “Tell me more…” or “What might that look like?”)\n5. Encourage the client to provide examples:  \n    When a change talk theme is identified, ask for specific examples. This helps to engage further in the talk.\n6. Look back:  \n    Ask the client about a time before the current concern emerged. How were things better or different then?\n7. Look forward:  \n    This is where you can try using the miracle question, “If you were 100% successful in making the changes you want, what would be different?” Or simply ask how they would ideally like their life to be in the future. It can also help to consider what life would look like if the changes were not made and explore what the consequences of that might be.\n8. Identify extremes:  \n    Particularly useful when there is little expressed desire for change. Ask the client to describe possible extremes:“What is the worst-case scenario if you don’t make this change?” and “What are the best things that might happen if you do make this change?”\n9. Explore goals and values:  \n    Be curious about your client’s values and encourage active investigation of them. Explore what is truly important to them and what their goals are in life. If possible, ask your client to state goals explicitly. If there is a “problem” behavior, ask how that behavior fits in with the person’s goals or values. Does it help realize a goal or value, or does it interfere with achieving it?\n10. Come alongside:  \n     Here the therapist explicitly sides with the negative side of ambivalence (i.e., not making a change). “Perhaps xxx feels so important to you that you won’t give it up, no matter what the consequence.”\n\n## Download 5 Free Positive Psychology Tools\n\nStart thriving today with 5 free tools grounded in the science of positive psychology.\n\nDownload Tools\n\n## 17 Motivational Interviewing Affirmations\n\nAs already mentioned, affirmations are a key tool in MI. For them to be effective, there are a few suggestions to follow. In keeping with the person-centered spirit of motivational interviewing, the most important quality of any affirmation is that it must be genuine and express positive regard.\n\nAffirmations should be used to emphasize your client’s strengths and notice and appreciate any positive actions they take, particularly when this is in the direction of the specific change you are working toward.\n\nSome useful examples:\n\n* You are determined to get your health back.\n* I appreciate your efforts despite the discomfort you’re in.\n* Thank you for all your hard work today.\n* You’re determined to make changes.\n* Despite your difficulties, you’re still willing to try.\n* You are clearly a very resourceful person.\n* Even though things are difficult right now, you try so hard to…\n* You handled yourself really well in that situation.\n* That’s a good suggestion.\n* You’re a strong person, a real survivor.\n* I appreciate your openness and honesty today.\n* That was a lot of work.\n* You pulled it off.\n* You don’t give up, even when it’s tough going.\n* You worked so hard to figure it out.\n* You didn’t know if you could do it, but you tried anyway.\n* It took a lot of courage to come in today.\n\n## Helpful Exercises for Your Sessions\n\nIt is important to note that MI is not a technique or clearly demarcated procedure but, rather, a guiding style for enhancing intrinsic motivation to change (Rollnick, Miller, & Butler, 2008).\n\nThe strategies suggested above for eliciting change talk should be used flexibly, and for motivational interviewing to be effective, therapists should stay true to the humanistic underpinnings of the MI spirit (Miller & Rollnick, 2009).\n\nThe skill in MI is to use the OARS to encourage, support, and motivate your client while staying alert to any change talk and responding directly to this. For these reasons, there are few suggested exercises, but the following ideas are considered intrinsically rooted in [Motivational Interviewing principles](https://positivepsychology.com/motivational-interviewing-principles/):\n\n### Agenda mapping\n\nThe therapist uses the OARS skills to encourage the client to establish the conversation’s focus and what they want to achieve from the session. A collaborative agenda should be developed that ensures the work concentrates on the most pertinent issue.\n\n## World’s Largest Positive Psychology Resource\n\n*The Positive Psychology Toolkit©* is a groundbreaking practitioner resource containing over 500 science-based exercises, activities, interventions, questionnaires, and assessments created by experts using the latest positive psychology research.\n\nUpdated monthly. 100% science-based.\n\n*“The best positive psychology resource out there!”*   \n — Emiliya Zhivotovskaya, Flourishing Center CEO\n\n[Get Instant Access](https://pro.positivepsychology.com/sale-page/positive-psychology-toolkit/)\n\n### Continuing the paragraph\n\nThis is a reflective listening method in which the therapist offers what might be the next (as yet unspoken) sentence in the client’s paragraph.

The aim is to first “elicit” what the client already knows, then fill in any gaps or misconceptions (provide), and finally to explore how that fits with the client’s experience (elicit).\n\nMotivational interviewing: Core clinician skills - Heart Foundation\n\n## A Note on MI in CBT\n\nResearch has demonstrated that motivational interviewing can be synergistic with Cognitive Behavioral Therapy ([CBT](https://positivepsychology.com/cbt/)) and lead to improved treatment outcomes (e.g., Arkowitz & Burke, 2008; Flynn, 2011).\n\nMI can be used during CBT to enhance motivation, resolve ambivalence, and reduce resistance (Arkowitz & Burke, 2008). There are useful similarities in the collaborative approach to working with clients inherent in both approaches, emphasizing [goal setting](https://positivepsychology.com/goal-setting/) and focusing on specific problems or behaviors (Flynn, 2011).\n\nHowever, one notable difference is that in MI, the client is always viewed as the expert and the key change agent, whereas in CBT, the therapist is usually assumed to be the key change agent (Flynn, 2011).\n\nCBT is intended to provide clients with something they lack, such as coping skills, restructured cognitions, or psychoeducation. In contrast, MI is focused on “eliciting from people that which is already there” (Miller & Rollnick, 2009, p. 134).\n\nAs mentioned, MI techniques can be woven into the CBT treatment to enhance motivation to change.

Separate from the principles, we also have techniques, which are ways to apply those principles. The four techniques, which form the foundations for our motivational interviewing questions, make the acronym OARS (Haque & D’Souza, 2019; Miller & Rollnick, 2002): Open questions Affirmations Reflective listening Summarizing Open-ended questions, such as those we’ve explored earlier in this article, are about getting [...] change.Practice is key to mastering this skill. Start with simple reflections and open questions. Then, build up to more complex techniques over time. Remember to listen deeply and avoid pushing your own agenda.The OARS framework provides a helpful structure. Open questions, affirmations, reflections, and summaries keep conversations productive. Combine these with change talk to move clients forward.Motivational interviewing takes patience. Change rarely happens overnight. Your role is to plant [...] involves affirming the individual’s efforts and progress towards change and recognizing the challenges they have overcome. This can build motivation and encourage further progress. Reflective listening: Motivational interviewing involves actively listening to the individual and demonstrating an understanding of their thoughts and feelings. This can involve reflecting on what the individual has said, using phrases like “It sounds like you’re saying…” or “It seems like you’re feeling…”\nRaw Content: Motivational interviewing is a therapeutic approach from counseling and psychology that aims to enhance a client’s intrinsic motivation. The four key principles of motivational interviewing are remembered through the acronym RULE (Haque & D’Souza, 2019): resist the righting reflect, understand the client’s motivations, lisen with empathy, and empower the client (explained later in this article). Motivational interviewing questions should facilitate self-reflection on personal motivations. They tend to be non-judgmental and empathetic open-ended questions, such as: “Describe to me how your life would be different if you were to achieve your goal?” For the sake of this article, I’ve separated out motivational interviewing examples into four primary categories: exploring ambivalence and importance, assessing confidence and self-efficacy, exploring personal goals and values, and developing a change plan. Each category, explored in order, can help to facilitate important principles from the motivational interviewing technique, and especially, the principle of client empowerment. These questions are designed to help clients self-reflect on ambivalent feelings (such as feelings of uncertainty or conflict) on relation to life changes they are contemplating. Counselors will often work with clients to explore the change from various perspectives, including pros, cons, and alternatives, in order to help them gain clarity (Hohman, 2021). Examples: Can you tell me about the pros and cons of making this change? Tell me about your current concerns about the situation. What is concerning you that’s making you want to make changes? Let’s explore the potential benefits of making this change. Can you tell me about some things you might see as positive outcomes of the change? Okay, how about your life if you don’t make the change? Could you describe life if you chose not to make a change? You said you feel uncertain about whether or not to make this change. Tell me what those feelings are? Let’s look at what’s most important in your life. Could you list for me the things that you consider most important, and how might this change affect those factors of your life? Do you think you could verbalize your internal conflicts that you may be feeling regarding this change? Let’s explore some drawbacks of making this change. What do you consider to be the main potential negative outcomes? Let’s name some things that would make you feel more confident about making the change. What would have to happen to trigger you to become excited about this change? This category is all about self-belief. It involves asking questions that are designed to help clients reflect on whether they have an internal locus of control, which means whether they think this change is within their power and control. Several methods in clinical psychology can be used here, including focusing on realistic expectations rather than outliers (from CBT), exploring previous successes and challenges, and looking at resources within their control (Miller & Rose, 2015). Ideally, these questions can help clients get a realistic understanding of their own capacity to effect change. Examples: On a scale of 1-10, how confident are you in your ability to make this change? What factors contribute to that level of confidence? What would it take to move one point higher on that scale? Can you think of a time when you faced a similar challenge? How did it end? In that previous time you faced the challenge, what resources and people did you draw upon to help you through? Can you describe a past experience where you overcame a challenge and successfully achieved long-term change? What did you learn from that experience? What personal strengths or resources do you have that could help you make this change? Compared to the last time you made an effort to effect change, are there new resources, skills, or support networks you can draw upon? What specific strategies have worked for you in the past that have really helped you to achieve intrinsic motivation? What do you realistically think it would take to get back to that mindset? What obstacles have you faced in previous attempts to make a change? How might you approach these obstacles differently this time? What skills or knowledge do you think you would need to acquire or improve upon to feel more confident in making this change? How could you obtain them? These questions ask a student to self-reflect on the underlying reasons for wanting to take action. It reflect on their personal values, their goals, and whether their goals are aligned with their values (Miller & Rollnick, 2002; Naar & Suarez, 2021). If a change is connected with the client’s deeper goals (long-term) and aspirations, the client may develop a deeper intrinsic motivation mindset. Examples: What is most important to you in life? How does making this change fit with those priorities? How would your life look different if you successfully made this change? What are your long-term goals or aspirations? How does making this change relate to those goals? How does your current behavior or situation align with what truly matters to you? What aspects of your life do you feel most proud of, and how does this change connect to those achievements? How do your personal values or beliefs support your desire for change? If you were to look back on your life 10 years from now, what would you want to have accomplished or experienced? How does this change fit into that vision? What specific aspects of this change are most closely aligned with your personal values or goals? How does making this change contribute to your overall sense of well-being or personal fulfillment? Are there any ways in which your current behavior conflicts with your personal values or long-term goals? How does that make you feel? Questions in this category are about taking actions that align with the client’s values and aspirations. These questions tend to emerge later in the process when the client has achieved some clarity and overcome ambivalence (Rosengren, 2017). Such questions help clients identify specific steps that will enable them to achieve the goals they have independently committed to. It is important that the actionable plan is perceived to be realistic to the client (Naar & Suarez, 2021); and in that vein, the client should also be able to anticipate potential barriers and identify how they will handle them when they arise. Examples: In what ways can you break down the change process into smaller, more manageable steps that would increase your confidence in achieving the overall goal?\n(explore the ‘chunking technique’ with your client) What are some concrete steps you can take to start making this change? How can you overcome potential obstacles or challenges in the process? How will you monitor your progress and adjust your plan as needed to stay on track toward your goal? What are some strategies you can use to maintain motivation and commitment when you face setbacks or difficulties during the change process? How can you establish a realistic timeline for achieving your goal, considering the various steps and milestones you’ve identified? What self-care or coping strategies can you incorporate into your plan to manage stress or other emotional challenges that may arise during the change process? How can you involve your support network, such as friends, family, or professionals, in your change plan to provide encouragement and accountability? How will you celebrate or reward yourself for reaching milestones or successfully making progress towards your goal? Read Also: Intrinsic Motivation vs Extrinsic Motivation At the beginning of this article, I noted four motivational interviewing principles, which are summarized in the acronym RULE: resist the righting reflect, understand the client’s motivations, listen with empathy, and empower the client (Haque & D’Souza, 2019). Below, these principles are summarized. Resist the righting reflex: The righting reflex is a reflexive desire to “fix” or “correct” the client’s statements, thoughts, feelings, or behaviors. This is ideally resisted in counseling in order to allow the client to achieve personal self-discovery, which will lead to more commitment in the long term. This also amplifies the client’s sense of self-empowerment and locus of control (Naar & Suarez, 2021). Understand the client’s motivations: The client’s motivations may be unclear, different to what we may assume, or even surprising. Acknowledging that each person has their own motivations allows us to learn about their motivations without making assumptions or inserting ourselves into the conversation. Furthermore, when we learn the client’s motivations, we can often learn how these motivations do or do not connect with their values (Haque & D’Souza, 2019). Listen with empathy: A nonjudgmental space is necessary to help the client worth through their concerns and desires (Hohman, 2021). Without nonjudgmental empathy, the client may not feel comfortable sharing their thoughts and feelings authentically and fully. Listening with empathy requires validating the client’s experiences and demonstrating active interest. Empower the client: A core goal of motivational interviewing is to have the client leave with a sense of intrinsic motivation and control over their path forward (Haque & D’Souza, 2019). To do this, the counselor can work with the client to name their strengths, resources, and abilities they can draw upon moving forward. By emphasizing the client’s autonomy, competence, and confidence, the motivational listening process shows the client that change is in their hands. Separate from the principles, we also have techniques, which are ways to apply those principles. The four techniques, which form the foundations for our motivational interviewing questions, make the acronym OARS (Haque & D’Souza, 2019; Miller & Rollnick, 2002): Open questions Affirmations Reflective listening Summarizing Open-ended questions, such as those we’ve explored earlier in this article, are about getting the client to express themselves without pushing them into a specific direction (Haque & D’Souza, 2019). Open-ended questions are highly effective in getting clients to open up because the answers are necessarily fully-formed explanations rather than yes/no responses. By eliciting fuller, more detailed responses, we’re inviting the client to express themselves more fully and authentically. In turn, it is our job to genuinely listen and engage with the statements they are making in a non-judgmental way. Affirmations are statements to the client that affirm the client’s experiences and feelings. They help the client feel heard and acknowledged. Statements of affirmation may also help build a client’s self-belief, especially when the affirmations bring to the surface the client’s genuine personal strengths, such as the resilience they have shown or their unique abilities (Haque & D’Souza, 2019). However, the affirmations need to be genuine in order for them to be effective and to sustain an honest relationship with the client. Reflective listening is all about ensuring communication is clear and well-understood. It reflects what has been said in order to achieve clarification. This can help in situations where the listener misunderstood or misheard what was said, or when the speaker said something in a way that wasn’t exactly what they had intended to mean. Miller & Rollnick (2002) identify three core techniques in reflective listening: repeating or rephrasing, paraphrasing, and reflecting feelings. Repeating and rephrasing involves repeating synonyms of what has been said or the direct phrases of what has been said to ensure the meaning behind the message is effectively received. Paraphrasing is similar but involves a complete rewording of the core sentiment of what was said in order to check for understanding. Reflection of feeling involves re-stating how the speaker felt. This demonstrates empathy and captures the intent as much as the exact meaning of the speaker’s message. Extending from reflective listening, a summary will occur at a checkpoint in the conversation such as a transition point or conclusion to a part of the discussion. During a summary, the speaker states that they will be summarizing and asking for input on the content of the summary. For example, you might say “So, what I understand you to be saying so far is…” The speaker should also be focusing on what Miller and Rollnick (2002) call ‘change statements’, such as statements that the client has made that a) recognize the problem, b) demonstrate concern, c) express intention to change, and d) express optimism. However, be sure to be authentic and accurate in your summary by, for example, reflecting the speaker’s ambivalence or concerns. Motivational interviewing is used by counselors when they are working with clients who struggle to achieve behavioral change in their own lives. Through this method, the counselor helps the client to work through ambivalence, align their goals with their values, and recognize their power to effect change in their own lives.

Motivational interviewing questions aim to build motivation and commitment to change. They help people explore their mixed feelings about change. This makes it easier to move forward. The questions also help people come up with their own solutions, making them more likely to follow through.According to a systematic review titled “Motivational Interviewing: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,” published in the British Journal of General Practice, motivational interviewing questions have been shown to effectively address a wide range of behavioral issues and health conditions, outperforming traditional advice-giving in approximately 75% of studies reviewed. What Are Motivational Interviewing Questions?Motivational interviewing (MI) questions help people explore their thoughts and feelings about change. These questions aim to boost a person’s drive to make positive shifts in their life.MI questions are open-ended queries used in counseling, therapy, coaching, and healthcare settings. They help clients think about their behaviors and reasons for change. These questions don’t judge or push for a specific answer. Instead, they invite people to reflect on their own motivations.MI questions serve several key functions:They encourage self-reflectionThey help uncover personal reasons for changeThey build trust between the counselor and clientThey support the client’s autonomyBy asking the right questions, counselors and coaches guide clients to voice their own arguments for change. This self-motivation is often more powerful than outside pressure.How MI Questions Facilitate ChangeMI questions help people work through mixed feelings about change. When an individual is not sure about changing, these questions can help sort out their thoughts. They bring out “change talk” – the person’s own words about why and how they might change.Some ways MI questions help:They explore the good and not-so-good sides of current behaviorThey ask about an individual’s hopes and goals for the futureThey look at times when an individual made positive changes beforeThese questions put a person in charge of their choices. We are the experts in our own lives. The practitioner’s job is to help the client find their own reasons and ways to change. This approach makes the individual more likely to stick with the changes they decide to make.Benefits Of Motivational Interviewing QuestionsMotivational interviewing questions help people change behaviors and improve their lives. They also give practitioners useful tools for their work.For ClientsThe client gains more control over their choices when asked motivational questions. These questions help the client think about why they want to change. They become more aware of their goals and values.Motivational questions reduce their defenses. They feel less judged and more understood. This makes them more open to exploring new ideas.These questions boost confidence. The client starts to see their own strengths and abilities. This helps them believe in their power to change.Your client will learn to solve their own problems. The questions guide them to find their own answers. This skill helps them long after the interview ends.For PractitionersYou build better relationships with clients using these questions. They show you care about the client’s views. This trust helps clients open up more.The questions help you avoid arguments. You don’t need to convince clients to change. Instead, you guide them to their own reasons for change.You learn more about your clients’ needs and values. This helps you tailor your approach to each person. Your work becomes more effective.These questions save you time and energy. Clients do most of the talking and thinking. You don’t have to come up with all the solutions yourself.Motivational Interviewing QuestionsMotivational interviewing uses different question types to explore their thoughts and feelings. These questions aim to spark change and build motivation.Open-Ended MI QuestionsOpen-ended questions can’t be answered with a simple “yes” or “no.” They let people share more about their thoughts and feelings. These questions often start with words like “what,” “how,” or “tell me about.” They give you space to talk freely.What does a typical day look like for you when things are going well?How do you see this situation impacting your future?What’s one thing you wish others understood about your experience?A study titled “Adherence to Principles of Motivational Interviewing and Client Within-Session Behavior,” published in Behavioural and Cognitive Psychotherapy, 2006, states the use of more open questions by the therapist was related to a better interaction score between the client and the therapist and showed a trend towards increases in change talk.Eliciting Change Talk Questions These questions try to get you talking about change. They focus on your reasons for wanting to change. They might ask about your hopes for the future or what you don’t like about your current situation.What would it mean to you to overcome this challenge?How would your life improve if you made this change?What’s one reason you feel it might be worth making a change?Exploring Ambivalence QuestionsThese questions look at your mixed feelings about change. They help you think about the good and bad sides of changing. They might ask what worries you about change or what you like about your current habits.What are some things you like about your current situation, and what are some things you don’t like?How do you weigh the benefits and drawbacks of staying where you are versus making a change?What would need to happen for you to feel more confident about making a change?Scaling QuestionsScaling questions use numbers to measure your feelings or readiness to change. You might be asked to rate something on a scale from 1 to 10. This helps you and the interviewer see where you stand.On a scale of 1-10, how important is it to you to address this issue? What makes you choose that number instead of a lower one?On a scale of 1-10, how confident are you in your ability to make this change? What would help you move closer to a 10?On a scale of 1-10, how ready do you feel to take the first step? What’s holding you back from being at a 10?Strength-Based QuestionsThese questions focus on your strengths and past successes. They help you see what you’re good at and how you’ve overcome challenges before. This can boost your confidence in your ability to change.What strengths or skills have helped you overcome challenges in the past?Who in your life believes in you, and how have they supported you?What personal qualities make you feel capable of succeeding in this situation?Visioning QuestionsVisioning questions ask you to imagine a better future. They help you picture what life could be like after making a change. This can increase your motivation to work towards that future.If everything worked out exactly the way you wanted, what would your life look like a year from now?Imagine you’ve already achieved this change—what does your day-to-day life feel like?If you could design your ideal future, what role would this change play in it?Clarifying QuestionsClarifying questions helps make sure the interviewer understands you correctly. They might repeat back what you said and ask if that’s right. This shows they’re listening and helps avoid mix-ups.When you say you’re feeling stuck, what does that mean to you?Can you help me understand what makes this decision so difficult for you?What does success in this area look like to you?MI Questions For Each Stage Of ChangeMI takes its theoretical basis from the Transtheoretical Model. The Transtheoretical Model, also known as Stages of Change, was developed by James Prochaska and Carlo DiClemente in the late 1970s to explain how people progress through stages of behavior change.It provides a framework for understanding and supporting personal transformation.MI questions vary based on a person’s readiness for change. Let’s explore questions for each stage.Precontemplation Stage QuestionsQuestions in this stage aim to raise awareness.\nYou might ask:What would have to happen for you to consider making a change in the future?How do you feel about the way things are right now?What are some reasons you might not feel ready to make a change?These questions help people think about potential problems without pressure.Contemplation Stage QuestionsHere, questions explore ambivalence. Try asking:What are some benefits you think you might experience if you decided to make a change?What’s holding you back from making a decision about this change?How can I help you move from thinking about change to feeling ready to take action?These questions help weigh options and build motivation.Preparation Stage QuestionsQuestions now focus on planning. You could ask:What steps have you already thought about taking to start this change?How can you set yourself up for success in the first few weeks of making this change?What resources or support do you think you’ll need to get started?These questions help create a clear action plan.Action Stage Questions In this stage, questions support ongoing efforts. Ask:What’s been going well since you started making this change?What challenges have come up, and how have you handled them?How can you build on your current momentum to keep moving forward?These questions reinforce progress and problem-solve.Maintenance Stage QuestionsQuestions here aim to prevent relapse. Consider asking:What strategies have been most effective in helping you maintain this change?What are some warning signs you might notice if you start slipping back into old habits?How can you continue to reinforce the positive habits you’ve built?These questions strengthen commitment to new behaviors.Relapse QuestionsIf relapse occurs, questions focus on learning and moving forward. Ask:What did you learn from this experience that can help you move forward?What do you think contributed to returning to old behaviors, and how can you address that moving forward?How can you refocus on your goals and rebuild confidence in your ability to succeed?These questions help regain motivation and prevent future slips.Example Motivational Interviewing Questions for Different ScenariosAdditionWhat are some reasons you might want to cut back or stop using substances?How does your substance use affect the things in life that matter most to you?If you decided to make a change, what would the first step look like?Alcohol UseHow do you feel your drinking impacts your daily life or relationships?What are some positive changes you think could happen if you reduced your alcohol use?On a scale of 1-10, how ready are you to make changes to your drinking habits?

These key strategies can help you improve your approach and get better results with clients.Be Curious, Not JudgmentalStay open-minded when asking questions. Avoid making assumptions or passing judgment on the client’s responses. Instead, approach each question with genuine curiosity about their perspective.Use open-ended questions that encourage the client to share more details. For example, ask “What are your thoughts on making this change?” rather than “Don’t you think you should make this change?”Show empathy and understanding in your tone and body language. Nod and use phrases like “I see” to acknowledge what they’re saying without agreeing or disagreeing.Adapt Questions To The Client’s NeedsTailor your questions to each individual client. Pay attention to their unique situation, goals, and challenges.Start with broader questions, then ask more specific follow-ups based on their responses. This allows you to dig deeper into areas that seem most relevant or important to them.Be flexible and willing to change direction if needed. If a line of questioning isn’t productive, try a different approach.Use scaling questions to help clients assess their readiness for change. For example: “On a scale of 1-10, how confident are you that you can make this change?”Focus On Active Listening And ReflectionGive your full attention to the client’s responses. Listen carefully not just to their words, but also their tone and body language.Use reflective statements to show you understand and to check your interpretation. For example: “It sounds like you’re feeling frustrated with your progress. Is that right?”Summarize key points periodically to ensure you’re on the same page. This also gives the client a chance to clarify or expand on anything you may have misunderstood.Ask follow-up questions that build on what the client has shared. This shows you’re listening and helps to deepen the conversation.ConclusionMotivational interviewing questions can transform your interactions with clients. These open-ended queries spark change talk and build motivation. By using them, you guide people to find their own reasons for change.Practice is key to mastering this skill. Start with simple reflections and open questions. Then, build up to more complex techniques over time. Remember to listen deeply and avoid pushing your own agenda.The OARS framework provides a helpful structure. Open questions, affirmations, reflections, and summaries keep conversations productive. Combine these with change talk to move clients forward.Motivational interviewing takes patience. Change rarely happens overnight. Your role is to plant seeds and nurture growth. Trust the process and celebrate small wins along the way.With practice, you’ll help clients tap into their innate wisdom and strengths. This empowering approach leads to lasting positive changes. Keep honing your skills to become a more effective helper and guide. Motivational interviewing (MI) questions are open-ended and non-judgmental, designed to explore a person or client’s motivations, feelings, and thoughts about behavior change. These questions create an atmosphere of acceptance and understanding, encouraging clients to reflect on their current behaviors, recognize any discrepancies between their current state and their goals, and address the client's beliefs about the importance of change. Understanding and evoking the client's intrinsic motivations is crucial in this process.When used effectively, these questions help clients become more motivated to change and take ownership of their growth. MI is a powerful tool for supporting individuals in achieving their goals and living their best lives.Click here to view on YouTubeMotivational interviewing questions are transformative tools in therapeutic settings, especially for sparking meaningful and productive conversations. They help create a supportive environment where clients feel comfortable expressing their thoughts and feelings. Let’s explore how these questions can benefit both clients and therapists.They uncover inner strengths and resourcesMotivational interviewing questions can guide clients in exploring their inner motivations and strengths. Think of it as tapping into your client's intrinsic motivation. By asking the right questions, you help them identify personal resources crucial for making successful changes. This process empowers client's self-efficacy and belief in their potential. They identify and resolve areas of ambivalenceMotivational interviewing is about helping clients resolve ambivalence about behavior change by using specific strategies and questioning techniques to promote self-reflection and clarity about their desires for change. These MI questions are fantastic tools for pinpointing areas where clients feel stuck or unsure, encouraging them to dig deep and understand the reasons behind their hesitation to change.These questions explore discrepancies between the client's values and current situation, fostering constructive discussions and helping clients gain clarity. This process supports clients in taking ownership of their decisions, making the path to change much smoother and more empowering.They foster open dialogue and reflective listening and develop plans for changeOne of the best things about motivational interviewing questions is how they open up a dialogue between you and your client. Emotional intelligence skills, such as empathy, play a crucial role in fostering this open dialogue and understanding the client's needs. This conversation allows a deeper understanding of your client’s needs and goals.Through this open communication, clients can explore different options and develop solid plans for change. This collaborative approach ensures clients feel supported and understood, which is critical to making lasting changes.Motivational interviewing uses the Stages of Change Model (Prochaska & DiClemente, 1983) to encourage people to make positive changes. Motivational interviewing skills, such as open-ended questions, affirmations, reflective listening, and summarizing, are essential for effective client-practitioner communication and facilitating behavioral change. These questions help us understand a person’s motivations and how to use them to foster positive change.Here are some Motivational Interviewing Questions and Examples you can use for each stage:PrecontemplationIn this stage, the individual is not yet considering a change. You can use these questions to help them move forward by increasing awareness of their current behavior and its impacts.Can you tell me more about your current thoughts and feelings about the behavior you’re considering changing in your own words?What have you noticed about the impact of this behavior on your life, relationships, and well-being?How important is it to change this behavior, and why?What are some of the potential consequences of not changing this behavior, and how concerned are you about these consequences?Example: For a client who is not yet considering quitting smoking, these questions can help them reflect on the negative impacts of smoking on their health and relationships, thereby initiating the contemplation of change. Understanding the client's own motivations can help initiate the contemplation of change.ContemplationYour client is considering change but has yet to commit to action. These questions can help facilitate their decision-making process by weighing the client's values against the pros and cons of change.What are the benefits and drawbacks of changing this behavior that you are currently weighing in your mind?How confident do you feel you could change this behavior, and what factors contribute to your confidence or lack thereof?What do you feel is holding you back from changing this behavior, and how might you overcome these obstacles?How might making changes to this behavior impact your life and the lives of those around you? How do you feel about these potential impacts?Example: For a client considering reducing alcohol consumption or substance abuse treatment, these questions can help them evaluate their decisional balance of the benefits of better health and relationships against the challenges of social pressure and withdrawal symptoms.PreparationThe individual is preparing to take action to change talk and has a plan. These questions can be utilized to explore further and clarify the steps your client is taking to prepare for their desired change.What specific steps are you considering to change this behavior, and how do you feel about these steps?What kind of support would be helpful for you as you prepare to change this behavior, and how might you seek this support?What potential challenges or barriers do you anticipate as you change this behavior, and how might you work to overcome these challenges?How will you measure progress as you make changes to this behavior, and what will success look like for you?Example: For a client planning to start a new exercise routine, these questions can help solidify their plan, identify necessary support, and anticipate challenges such as time management or physical limitations.ActionYour client is actively taking steps toward behavior change. You can ask these questions to support them better as they take more steps to achieve their goals.What changes have you made so far, and how do you feel about these changes?How are you tracking your progress as you change this behavior, and what are you learning from this process?What challenges or setbacks have you encountered during this process, and how have you worked to overcome them?How are you staying motivated as you make changes to this behavior, and what strategies are you finding helpful?Example: For a client who has begun a healthy eating plan, these questions can help them reflect on their progress, address any challenges, and stay motivated.MaintenanceIn this stage, your client has successfully made the behavior change and is working to sustain it over time. These questions can help support their progress and internal motivation to maintain the behavior change over time.What are you doing to maintain your changes so far, and how do you feel about your progress?What have you learned about yourself and your ability to make changes during this process, and how might you apply this learning to other areas of your life?What potential triggers or situations might put you at risk for relapse, and how can you prepare to navigate these situations?What support do you need to maintain your changes, and how might you get this support?Example: For a client maintaining sobriety, these questions can help them plan for potential triggers, reflect on their growth, and identify ongoing support needs.RelapseDuring this stage, the individual returns to old habits or behaviors after progressing. These questions and skills can assist your client in getting back on track.What led to the relapse, and how do you feel about this setback?What have you learned from this experience, and how might you apply this learning to future attempts to make changes to this behavior?What strategies have you found helpful in the past for overcoming setbacks and getting back on track, and how might you use these strategies now?What kind of support do you need to prevent future relapses, and how might you get this support?Example: For a client who has resumed smoking after quitting, these questions can help them understand the relapse, learn from the experience, and plan for future success in quitting smoking.Note that MI uses different techniques to help clients move through each stage of change with ease, motivation, and support.\nMotivational interviewing offers a respectful, collaborative approach to behavior change that aligns well with patient-centered care principles. By mastering MI techniques and questions, healthcare practitioners can empower their clients to make positive changes, leading to improved health outcomes and increased satisfaction for both clients and practitioners alike.Prochaska, J. O., & DiClemente, C. C. (1983). Stages and processes of self-change of smoking: Toward an integrative model of change. Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, 51(3), 390–395. No credit card required Motivational interviewing is a way to help people make good changes in their lives. It is a way to encourage people to make changes by themselves by looking at and thinking about their thoughts and feelings about change. Motivational interviewing was created in the 1980s and is now used in many places, like hospitals, places that help with substance abuse problems, and places that give mental health help. At its core, motivational interviewing is based on the idea that people are more likely to make changes when they feel motivated. It is a non-confrontational approach that focuses on helping individuals identify and overcome the barriers preventing them from making changes. Rather than using a one-size-fits-all approach, motivational interviewing is tailored to the specific needs and goals of the individual. This article will explore some common motivational interviewing questions and provide tips for using them effectively. So, this is the introduction to the article “motivational interviewing questions.” The principles of motivational interviewing Several fundamental principles underlie the practice of motivational interviewing. These principles include: Express empathy: One of the core principles of motivational interviewing is the importance of expressing empathy and understanding toward the individual’s experiences and perspective. This involves actively listening to the person and demonstrating an understanding of their thoughts and feelings. Develop discrepancy: Another principle of motivational interviewing is developing discrepancy, or helping the individual see the gap between where they are currently and where they want to be. This can involve asking questions to help the individual clarify their values and goals and to see the benefits of making a change. Roll with resistance: Motivational interviewing recognizes that change can be difficult and that individuals may often resist change. Rather than confronting or overcoming this resistance, motivational interviewing involves “rolling with” resistance by acknowledging and exploring it in a non-confrontational way. Support self-efficacy: Motivational interviewing also involves supporting the individual’s belief in their ability to make a change. This can include reinforcing their strengths and past successes and helping them identify and build on their existing resources and skills. Affirm: Motivational interviewing also involves affirming the individual’s efforts and progress toward change and recognizing the challenges they have overcome. This can build motivation and encourage further progress. By following these principles, practitioners can create a supportive and collaborative environment that helps individuals make positive changes. Common techniques used in motivational interviewing Several common techniques are used in motivational interviewing to help individuals explore their thoughts, feelings, and motivations around change. These techniques include: Open-ended questions: Motivational interviewing often involves asking open-ended, non-judgmental questions to help individuals explore their thoughts, feelings, and motivations around change. These questions are designed to help individuals reflect on their values and priorities and to understand the benefits and drawbacks of making (or not making) a change. Affirming statements: Motivational interviewing also involves affirming the individual’s efforts and progress towards change and recognizing the challenges they have overcome. This can build motivation and encourage further progress. Reflective listening: Motivational interviewing involves actively listening to the individual and demonstrating an understanding of their thoughts and feelings. This can involve reflecting on what the individual has said, using phrases like “It sounds like you’re saying…” or “It seems like you’re feeling…” Summarizing: Motivational interviewing may also involve summarizing the individual’s thoughts and feelings to help them see the big picture and to clarify their values and goals. Goal-setting: Motivational interviewing often involves helping individuals set specific, achievable goals that align with their values and motivations. This can help to build motivation and momentum toward change. By using these techniques, practitioners can create a supportive and collaborative environment that helps individuals to explore and resolve their ambivalence around change. Examples of motivational interviewing questions Motivational interviewing involves open-ended, non-judgmental questions to help individuals explore their thoughts, feelings, and motivations around change. Here are some examples of motivational interviewing questions that practitioners might use: “What are your values and priorities in life?” “What are your goals for the future?” “How do you see making this change fitting into your values and goals?” “What are the benefits of making this change?” “What are the drawbacks of making this change?” “What have you done in the past that has helped you make changes?” “What strengths and resources could help you make this change?” “What challenges do you foresee in making this change?” “What support do you need to help you make this change?” “What small steps could you take towards making this change?” “What are the potential benefits of making this change for you and those around you?” “What are the potential drawbacks or challenges of making this change?” “How confident are you in your ability to make this change?” “What past experiences do you have with making changes in your life?” “How do you envision your life after making this change?” “What is important to you about making this change?” Common Interview Questions and How to Answer Them These questions help individuals explore their thoughts, feelings, and motivations around change and clarify their values and goals. Instead, they are intended to help the individual reflect on their thoughts and feelings and identify their reasons for making (or not making) a change. Conclusion and resources for further learning about motivational interviewing Motivational interviewing is a powerful tool for helping individuals make positive life changes. It is a client-centered, directive method for enhancing intrinsic motivation to change by exploring and resolving ambivalence. Motivational interviewing is based on expressing empathy, developing discrepancy, rolling with resistance, supporting self-efficacy, and affirming progress. It involves using open-ended, non-judgmental questions and other techniques to help individuals explore their thoughts, feelings, and motivations around change. Several resources are available to learn about motivational interviewing, including books, articles, and training programs. Some recommended resources for further learning about motivational interviewing include: “Motivational Interviewing: Helping People Change” by William R. Miller and Stephen Rollnick “Motivational Interviewing in Health Care: Helping Patients Change Behavior” by Stephen Rollnick, William R. Miller, and Christopher C. Butler “Motivational Interviewing: Preparing People for Change” by William R. Miller and Stephen Rollnick These resources provide a more in-depth understanding of the principles and techniques of motivational interviewing and can help practitioners develop their skills in using this approach.\nMotivational interviewing is a therapeutic approach from counseling and psychology that aims to enhance a client’s intrinsic motivation. The four key principles of motivational interviewing are remembered through the acronym RULE (Haque & D’Souza, 2019): resist the righting reflect, understand the client’s motivations, lisen with empathy, and empower the client (explained later in this article). Motivational interviewing questions should facilitate self-reflection on personal motivations. They tend to be non-judgmental and empathetic open-ended questions, such as: “Describe to me how your life would be different if you were to achieve your goal?” For the sake of this article, I’ve separated out motivational interviewing examples into four primary categories: exploring ambivalence and importance, assessing confidence and self-efficacy, exploring personal goals and values, and developing a change plan. Each category, explored in order, can help to facilitate important principles from the motivational interviewing technique, and especially, the principle of client empowerment. These questions are designed to help clients self-reflect on ambivalent feelings (such as feelings of uncertainty or conflict) on relation to life changes they are contemplating. Counselors will often work with clients to explore the change from various perspectives, including pros, cons, and alternatives, in order to help them gain clarity (Hohman, 2021). Examples: Can you tell me about the pros and cons of making this change? Tell me about your current concerns about the situation. What is concerning you that’s making you want to make changes? Let’s explore the potential benefits of making this change. Can you tell me about some things you might see as positive outcomes of the change? Okay, how about your life if you don’t make the change? Could you describe life if you chose not to make a change? You said you feel uncertain about whether or not to make this change. Tell me what those feelings are? Let’s look at what’s most important in your life. Could you list for me the things that you consider most important, and how might this change affect those factors of your life? Do you think you could verbalize your internal conflicts that you may be feeling regarding this change? Let’s explore some drawbacks of making this change. What do you consider to be the main potential negative outcomes? Let’s name some things that would make you feel more confident about making the change. What would have to happen to trigger you to become excited about this change? This category is all about self-belief. It involves asking questions that are designed to help clients reflect on whether they have an internal locus of control, which means whether they think this change is within their power and control. Several methods in clinical psychology can be used here, including focusing on realistic expectations rather than outliers (from CBT), exploring previous successes and challenges, and looking at resources within their control (Miller & Rose, 2015). Ideally, these questions can help clients get a realistic understanding of their own capacity to effect change. Examples: On a scale of 1-10, how confident are you in your ability to make this change? What factors contribute to that level of confidence? What would it take to move one point higher on that scale? Can you think of a time when you faced a similar challenge? How did it end? In that previous time you faced the challenge, what resources and people did you draw upon to help you through? Can you describe a past experience where you overcame a challenge and successfully achieved long-term change? What did you learn from that experience? What personal strengths or resources do you have that could help you make this change? Compared to the last time you made an effort to effect change, are there new resources, skills, or support networks you can draw upon? What specific strategies have worked for you in the past that have really helped you to achieve intrinsic motivation? What do you realistically think it would take to get back to that mindset? What obstacles have you faced in previous attempts to make a change? How might you approach these obstacles differently this time? What skills or knowledge do you think you would need to acquire or improve upon to feel more confident in making this change? How could you obtain them? These questions ask a student to self-reflect on the underlying reasons for wanting to take action. It reflect on their personal values, their goals, and whether their goals are aligned with their values (Miller & Rollnick, 2002; Naar & Suarez, 2021). If a change is connected with the client’s deeper goals (long-term) and aspirations, the client may develop a deeper intrinsic motivation mindset. Examples: What is most important to you in life? How does making this change fit with those priorities? How would your life look different if you successfully made this change? What are your long-term goals or aspirations? How does making this change relate to those goals? How does your current behavior or situation align with what truly matters to you? What aspects of your life do you feel most proud of, and how does this change connect to those achievements? How do your personal values or beliefs support your desire for change? If you were to look back on your life 10 years from now, what would you want to have accomplished or experienced? How does this change fit into that vision? What specific aspects of this change are most closely aligned with your personal values or goals? How does making this change contribute to your overall sense of well-being or personal fulfillment? Are there any ways in which your current behavior conflicts with your personal values or long-term goals? How does that make you feel? Questions in this category are about taking actions that align with the client’s values and aspirations. These questions tend to emerge later in the process when the client has achieved some clarity and overcome ambivalence (Rosengren, 2017). Such questions help clients identify specific steps that will enable them to achieve the goals they have independently committed to. It is important that the actionable plan is perceived to be realistic to the client (Naar & Suarez, 2021); and in that vein, the client should also be able to anticipate potential barriers and identify how they will handle them when they arise. Examples: In what ways can you break down the change process into smaller, more manageable steps that would increase your confidence in achieving the overall goal?\n(explore the ‘chunking technique’ with your client) What are some concrete steps you can take to start making this change? How can you overcome potential obstacles or challenges in the process? How will you monitor your progress and adjust your plan as needed to stay on track toward your goal? What are some strategies you can use to maintain motivation and commitment when you face setbacks or difficulties during the change process? How can you establish a realistic timeline for achieving your goal, considering the various steps and milestones you’ve identified? What self-care or coping strategies can you incorporate into your plan to manage stress or other emotional challenges that may arise during the change process? How can you involve your support network, such as friends, family, or professionals, in your change plan to provide encouragement and accountability? How will you celebrate or reward yourself for reaching milestones or successfully making progress towards your goal? Read Also: Intrinsic Motivation vs Extrinsic Motivation At the beginning of this article, I noted four motivational interviewing principles, which are summarized in the acronym RULE: resist the righting reflect, understand the client’s motivations, listen with empathy, and empower the client (Haque & D’Souza, 2019). Below, these principles are summarized. Resist the righting reflex: The righting reflex is a reflexive desire to “fix” or “correct” the client’s statements, thoughts, feelings, or behaviors. This is ideally resisted in counseling in order to allow the client to achieve personal self-discovery, which will lead to more commitment in the long term. This also amplifies the client’s sense of self-empowerment and locus of control (Naar & Suarez, 2021). Understand the client’s motivations: The client’s motivations may be unclear, different to what we may assume, or even surprising. Acknowledging that each person has their own motivations allows us to learn about their motivations without making assumptions or inserting ourselves into the conversation. Furthermore, when we learn the client’s motivations, we can often learn how these motivations do or do not connect with their values (Haque & D’Souza, 2019). Listen with empathy: A nonjudgmental space is necessary to help the client worth through their concerns and desires (Hohman, 2021). Without nonjudgmental empathy, the client may not feel comfortable sharing their thoughts and feelings authentically and fully. Listening with empathy requires validating the client’s experiences and demonstrating active interest. Empower the client: A core goal of motivational interviewing is to have the client leave with a sense of intrinsic motivation and control over their path forward (Haque & D’Souza, 2019). To do this, the counselor can work with the client to name their strengths, resources, and abilities they can draw upon moving forward. By emphasizing the client’s autonomy, competence, and confidence, the motivational listening process shows the client that change is in their hands. Separate from the principles, we also have techniques, which are ways to apply those principles. The four techniques, which form the foundations for our motivational interviewing questions, make the acronym OARS (Haque & D’Souza, 2019; Miller & Rollnick, 2002): Open questions Affirmations Reflective listening Summarizing Open-ended questions, such as those we’ve explored earlier in this article, are about getting the client to express themselves without pushing them into a specific direction (Haque & D’Souza, 2019). Open-ended questions are highly effective in getting clients to open up because the answers are necessarily fully-formed explanations rather than yes/no responses. By eliciting fuller, more detailed responses, we’re inviting the client to express themselves more fully and authentically. In turn, it is our job to genuinely listen and engage with the statements they are making in a non-judgmental way. Affirmations are statements to the client that affirm the client’s experiences and feelings. They help the client feel heard and acknowledged. Statements of affirmation may also help build a client’s self-belief, especially when the affirmations bring to the surface the client’s genuine personal strengths, such as the resilience they have shown or their unique abilities (Haque & D’Souza, 2019). However, the affirmations need to be genuine in order for them to be effective and to sustain an honest relationship with the client. Reflective listening is all about ensuring communication is clear and well-understood. It reflects what has been said in order to achieve clarification. This can help in situations where the listener misunderstood or misheard what was said, or when the speaker said something in a way that wasn’t exactly what they had intended to mean. Miller & Rollnick (2002) identify three core techniques in reflective listening: repeating or rephrasing, paraphrasing, and reflecting feelings. Repeating and rephrasing involves repeating synonyms of what has been said or the direct phrases of what has been said to ensure the meaning behind the message is effectively received. Paraphrasing is similar but involves a complete rewording of the core sentiment of what was said in order to check for understanding. Reflection of feeling involves re-stating how the speaker felt. This demonstrates empathy and captures the intent as much as the exact meaning of the speaker’s message. Extending from reflective listening, a summary will occur at a checkpoint in the conversation such as a transition point or conclusion to a part of the discussion. During a summary, the speaker states that they will be summarizing and asking for input on the content of the summary. For example, you might say “So, what I understand you to be saying so far is…” The speaker should also be focusing on what Miller and Rollnick (2002) call ‘change statements’, such as statements that the client has made that a) recognize the problem, b) demonstrate concern, c) express intention to change, and d) express optimism. However, be sure to be authentic and accurate in your summary by, for example, reflecting the speaker’s ambivalence or concerns. Motivational interviewing is used by counselors when they are working with clients who struggle to achieve behavioral change in their own lives. Through this method, the counselor helps the client to work through ambivalence, align their goals with their values, and recognize their power to effect change in their own lives.

Motivational interviewing with adolescents and young adults. Guilford Publications. Rosengren, D. B. (2017). Building motivational interviewing skills: A practitioner workbook. Guilford publications. Motivational interviewing is a therapeutic approach from counseling and psychology that aims to enhance a client’s intrinsic motivation. The four key principles of motivational interviewing are remembered through the acronym RULE (Haque & D’Souza, 2019): resist the righting reflect, understand the client’s motivations, lisen with empathy, and empower the client (explained later in this article). Motivational interviewing questions should facilitate self-reflection on personal motivations. They tend to be non-judgmental and empathetic open-ended questions, such as: “Describe to me how your life would be different if you were to achieve your goal?” For the sake of this article, I’ve separated out motivational interviewing examples into four primary categories: exploring ambivalence and importance, assessing confidence and self-efficacy, exploring personal goals and values, and developing a change plan. Each category, explored in order, can help to facilitate important principles from the motivational interviewing technique, and especially, the principle of client empowerment. These questions are designed to help clients self-reflect on ambivalent feelings (such as feelings of uncertainty or conflict) on relation to life changes they are contemplating. Counselors will often work with clients to explore the change from various perspectives, including pros, cons, and alternatives, in order to help them gain clarity (Hohman, 2021). Examples: Can you tell me about the pros and cons of making this change? Tell me about your current concerns about the situation. What is concerning you that’s making you want to make changes? Let’s explore the potential benefits of making this change. Can you tell me about some things you might see as positive outcomes of the change? Okay, how about your life if you don’t make the change? Could you describe life if you chose not to make a change? You said you feel uncertain about whether or not to make this change. Tell me what those feelings are? Let’s look at what’s most important in your life. Could you list for me the things that you consider most important, and how might this change affect those factors of your life? Do you think you could verbalize your internal conflicts that you may be feeling regarding this change? Let’s explore some drawbacks of making this change. What do you consider to be the main potential negative outcomes? Let’s name some things that would make you feel more confident about making the change. What would have to happen to trigger you to become excited about this change? This category is all about self-belief. It involves asking questions that are designed to help clients reflect on whether they have an internal locus of control, which means whether they think this change is within their power and control. Several methods in clinical psychology can be used here, including focusing on realistic expectations rather than outliers (from CBT), exploring previous successes and challenges, and looking at resources within their control (Miller & Rose, 2015). Ideally, these questions can help clients get a realistic understanding of their own capacity to effect change. Examples: On a scale of 1-10, how confident are you in your ability to make this change? What factors contribute to that level of confidence? What would it take to move one point higher on that scale? Can you think of a time when you faced a similar challenge? How did it end? In that previous time you faced the challenge, what resources and people did you draw upon to help you through? Can you describe a past experience where you overcame a challenge and successfully achieved long-term change? What did you learn from that experience? What personal strengths or resources do you have that could help you make this change? Compared to the last time you made an effort to effect change, are there new resources, skills, or support networks you can draw upon? What specific strategies have worked for you in the past that have really helped you to achieve intrinsic motivation? What do you realistically think it would take to get back to that mindset? What obstacles have you faced in previous attempts to make a change? How might you approach these obstacles differently this time? What skills or knowledge do you think you would need to acquire or improve upon to feel more confident in making this change?\nHow could you obtain them? These questions ask a student to self-reflect on the underlying reasons for wanting to take action. It reflect on their personal values, their goals, and whether their goals are aligned with their values (Miller & Rollnick, 2002; Naar & Suarez, 2021). If a change is connected with the client’s deeper goals (long-term) and aspirations, the client may develop a deeper intrinsic motivation mindset. Examples: What is most important to you in life? How does making this change fit with those priorities? How would your life look different if you successfully made this change? What are your long-term goals or aspirations? How does making this change relate to those goals?\nHow does your current behavior or situation align with what truly matters to you? What aspects of your life do you feel most proud of, and how does this change connect to those achievements? How do your personal values or beliefs support your desire for change? If you were to look back on your life 10 years from now, what would you want to have accomplished or experienced? How does this change fit into that vision? What specific aspects of this change are most closely aligned with your personal values or goals? How does making this change contribute to your overall sense of well-being or personal fulfillment? Are there any ways in which your current behavior conflicts with your personal values or long-term goals? How does that make you feel? Questions in this category are about taking actions that align with the client’s values and aspirations. These questions tend to emerge later in the process when the client has achieved some clarity and overcome ambivalence (Rosengren, 2017). Such questions help clients identify specific steps that will enable them to achieve the goals they have independently committed to. It is important that the actionable plan is perceived to be realistic to the client (Naar & Suarez, 2021); and in that vein, the client should also be able to anticipate potential barriers and identify how they will handle them when they arise. Examples: In what ways can you break down the change process into smaller, more manageable steps that would increase your confidence in achieving the overall goal? (explore the ‘chunking technique’ with your client) What are some concrete steps you can take to start making this change? How can you overcome potential obstacles or challenges in the process? How will you monitor your progress and adjust your plan as needed to stay on track toward your goal? What are some strategies you can use to maintain motivation and commitment when you face setbacks or difficulties during the change process? How can you establish a realistic timeline for achieving your goal, considering the various steps and milestones you’ve identified? What self-care or coping strategies can you incorporate into your plan to manage stress or other emotional challenges that may arise during the change process? How can you involve your support network, such as friends, family, or p"

The primary goal of ACT is to encourage individuals to accept their thoughts and feelings rather than fighting or feeling guilty about them while committing to actions aligned with their values.\n\nACT employs several key techniques, including cognitive defusion, acceptance, present-moment awareness, self-as-context, values clarification, and committed action. These techniques help individuals detach from unhelpful thoughts, embrace their experiences without avoidance, and focus on purposeful living.\n\nACT is applied in various contexts, including treating mental health conditions such as anxiety, depression, and stress-related disorders. A study by Carlile N, Link JS, Cowan A, et al. (2019) entitled “ACTing Like a Psychiatrist” says that ACT is also utilized in workplace stress management and chronic pain management, helping individuals alter their relationship with discomfort.\n\nAccording to registered dietician Jo Nash in a discussion about similar topic with Positive Psychology “ACT Therapy Techniques: 14+ interventions for Your Session”  says that common practices within ACT include mindfulness meditation, which cultivates present-moment awareness to observe thoughts and feelings non-judgmentally; values assessment, which involves reflecting on and identifying core personal values to guide behavior; and experiential exercises designed to promote acceptance and defusion from unhelpful thoughts.\n\nThe main benefits of ACT include improved emotional resilience, reduced psychological distress, enhanced self-awareness, and increased ability to pursue meaningful life goals despite challenges.\n\n## What is Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT)?\n\nAcceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) is **a form of psychotherapy that combines mindfulness and behavioral strategies to promote psychological flexibility, helping individuals accept their thoughts and emotions rather than avoiding or struggling with them.** Developed by psychologist Steven Hayes in the 1980s, ACT is rooted in the principles of third-wave Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), which emphasizes acceptance, mindfulness, and value-based action rather than symptom reduction alone.\n\nACT is grounded in Relational Frame Theory (RFT), a behavioral framework that explains how language and cognition influence human suffering. ACT encourages individuals to engage in meaningful activities aligned with their values while reducing the impact of negative thoughts and emotions. Numerous studies have demonstrated ACT’s effectiveness in treating various psychological conditions, including anxiety, depression, and chronic pain, making it a well-established, evidence-based intervention.\n\nDid you know most health insurance plans cover substance use disorder treatment? [Check your coverage online now.](https://rightchoicerecoverynj.com/insurance-verification/)\n\n## How Does Acceptance and Commitment Therapy Work?\n\nAcceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) works through six core processes that include **Cognitive Defusion, Acceptance, Present-Moment Awareness, Self-as-Context, Values Clarification, and Committed Action.** They help individuals develop psychological flexibility by changing their relationship with thoughts and emotions.\n\nThese core processes include:\n\n* **Cognitive Defusion:** Helps individuals detach from unhelpful thoughts by recognizing them as mere words or mental events rather than absolute truths. Techniques include observing thoughts without judgment and using metaphors to create distance from them.\n* **Acceptance:** Encourages individuals to embrace rather than avoid unpleasant emotions, thoughts, or experiences. This process reduces emotional struggle and allows for greater psychological openness.\n* **Present-Moment Awareness:** Involves cultivating mindfulness by focusing on the present rather than dwelling on the past or future. It helps individuals become more aware of their thoughts and feelings without becoming overwhelmed by them.\n* **Self-as-Context:** Teaches individuals to see themselves from a broader perspective, separating their core identity from their thoughts and emotions. This perspective fosters resilience and prevents over-identification with negative experiences.\n* **Values Clarification:** Encourages individuals to identify and connect with their core values, which guide meaningful actions and decisions. Clarifying values provides motivation and direction for behavior change.\n* **Committed Action:** Involves taking concrete steps toward value-based goals despite the presence of challenges or negative emotions. This process emphasizes persistence and flexibility in achieving meaningful objectives.\n\nFind renewed hope, purpose, and freedom from addiction\n\n### Begin Your Journey to Recovery\n\nMessage Us[Call Now (732) 838-6495](tel:732-838-6495)\n\n## What are the Core Techniques Used in ACT?\n\nThe core techniques used in Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) include **Cognitive defusion, acceptance strategies, and mindfulness practices**. These techniques help individuals develop psychological flexibility by changing their relationship with thoughts and emotions. These techniques foster acceptance, mindfulness, and commitment to value-based actions. Cognitive defusion helps individuals detach from unhelpful thoughts, acceptance strategies encourage embracing difficult emotions without resistance, and mindfulness practices promote present-moment awareness.\n\nAdditionally, self-context exercises help individuals view themselves from a broader perspective, while values clarification techniques guide them in identifying what truly matters in their lives. Finally, committed action strategies support individuals in taking purposeful steps toward meaningful goals despite challenges. These techniques work together to cultivate greater psychological resilience and well-being.\n\nThe core techniques used in Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) are as follows:\n\n### 1. Cognitive Defusion Strategies\n\nCognitive defusion is a core technique in Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) that helps individuals change their relationship with distressing thoughts by reducing their impact and influence. Instead of treating thoughts as absolute truths, defusion exercises encourage individuals to see thoughts as mere mental events that come and go. One common exercise involves repeating a distressing word or phrase aloud until it loses its meaning, helping to create distance from its emotional weight.\n\nAnother technique includes labeling thoughts by saying, “I am having the thought that…” to foster greater awareness and detachment. These exercises reduce cognitive rigidity, decrease emotional distress, and enhance psychological flexibility, allowing individuals to respond to their thoughts more effectively rather than being controlled by them.\n\n### 2. Mindfulness Practices\n\nA study entitled “Acceptance and Commitment Therapy: A Transdiagnostic Behavioral Intervention for Mental Health and Medical Conditions” by Lilian Dindo, Julia R. Van Liew &  Joanna J. Arch from Baylor College of Medicine addresses that [mindfulness practices](https://rightchoicerecoverynj.com/addiction/therapy/mindfulness-and-meditation/) in Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) are integral to fostering present-moment awareness and promoting a non-judgmental stance toward one’s thoughts and emotions. By observing experiences as they unfold, individuals respond with greater flexibility instead of reacting automatically.\n\nTechniques such as mindful breathing anchor attention to the present moment, reducing mental distractions. Body scanning encourages noticing physical sensations without attempting to change them, enhancing bodily awareness. Engaging in mindful observation of thoughts and feelings helps individuals recognize these mental events as transient, rather than absolute truths. Collectively, these practices support emotional regulation, increase self-awareness, and assist individuals in aligning their actions with personal values.\n\nStart Your Journey to Wellness Today\n\nContact us today to schedule an initial assessment or to learn more about our services.

Acceptance Exercises\n\nAcceptance exercises in Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) focus on embracing rather than avoiding or suppressing difficult thoughts and emotions. These strategies encourage individuals to allow unpleasant experiences to exist without resistance, recognizing them as natural aspects of life. Acceptance helps reduce emotional struggle and fosters psychological flexibility by shifting the focus from control to openness. Common exercises include:\n\n* **Emotion Labeling:** Acknowledging and naming emotions as they arise to create awareness and reduce their intensity.\n* **Allowing Thoughts and Feelings:** Practice letting emotions come and go without attempting to change or suppress them.\n* **Observing Without Judgment:** Watching thoughts and feelings like passing clouds builds detachment and reduces reactivity.\n* **Expansion Exercise:** Visualizing emotions as expanding within the body to create space for them rather than fighting them.\n* **Urge Surfing:** Observing urges without acting on them, allowing them to peak and subside naturally.\n\nThese exercises help individuals develop a healthier relationship with their inner experiences, enabling them to focus on meaningful actions.\n\n### 4. Values Clarification\n\nValues clarification in Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) is a vital process that helps individuals identify and connect with their core values, guiding them toward a more meaningful and fulfilling life. Understanding personal values provides direction and motivation, allowing individuals to make decisions and take actions aligned with what truly matters to them. Clarifying values helps individuals prioritize long-term goals over short-term discomfort, fostering resilience and commitment to personal growth. Practical activities used in values clarification include:\n\n* **Value Ranking:** Listing and ranking values to determine which are most important and meaningful.\n* **Life Compass Exercise:** Mapping different life areas (e.g., relationships, career, health) and assessing alignment with personal values.\n* **80th Birthday Exercise:** Imagining what one would want others to say about their life to clarify key values and aspirations.\n* **Writing a Values Statement:** Creating a personal mission statement that reflects core beliefs and guiding principles.\n* **Daily Actions Review:** Assessing whether daily behaviors align with chosen values and making necessary adjustments.\n\nThese activities help individuals gain clarity and motivation, enabling them to live with greater purpose and authenticity.\n\n### 5. Committed Action Plans\n\nCommitted action in Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) involves taking purposeful steps toward goals that reflect one’s core values, even when faced with challenges or discomfort. This process translates identified values into concrete behaviors, fostering a meaningful and fulfilling life. Clients are encouraged to set specific, achievable goals aligned with their values, promoting a sense of progress and personal growth. For instance, if someone values relationships, they might set a goal to spend quality time with family; if health is a priority, they might commit to a regular fitness routine.\n\nAccording to Olga v Berkout from Department of Psychology and Counseling, University of Texas in her study “Working with Values: An Overview of Approaches and Considerations in Implementation”, Techniques such as goal-setting frameworks, action planning, and behavioral tracking are employed to maintain consistency and accountability. By engaging in value-based actions, individuals build resilience and persistence, enabling them to navigate obstacles while staying true to their core values.\n\n## How is ACT Applied in Mental Health Treatment?\n\nAcceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) is applied in mental health treatment to address various psychological conditions **that include Depression, Anxiety Disorders, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), Chronic Pain Management,** by promoting psychological flexibility and value-based living.\n\nThe following are key applications of ACT:\n\n* **Depression:** ACT helps individuals with depression by encouraging acceptance of distressing thoughts and emotions while fostering engagement in meaningful activities.A study by Fledderus et al. (2012) entitled “ Acceptance and commitment therapy as guided self-help for psychological distress and positive mental health: a randomized controlled trial” found ACT to be effective in reducing symptoms of depression compared to traditional cognitive therapy.\n* **Anxiety Disorders:** ACT is effective in treating anxiety by teaching mindfulness techniques to manage anxious thoughts and avoid avoidance behaviors. ACT helps individuals develop healthier responses to anxiety-provoking situations.\n* **Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD):** A study entitled “Acceptance and Commitment Therapy: A Transdiagnostic Behavioral Intervention for Mental Health and Medical Conditions” by Lilian Dindo, Julia R. Van Liew &  Joanna J. Arch from Baylor College of Medicine found that ACT supports individuals with PTSD by promoting acceptance of traumatic memories and reducing emotional avoidance.\n* **Chronic Pain Management:** ACT is widely used in managing chronic pain by encouraging individuals to accept pain-related experiences without avoidance while pursuing valued activities.\n\nACT’s evidence-based approach has been validated through numerous clinical trials, making it a valuable therapeutic option for a range of mental health conditions.\n\n## What Are the Benefits of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy?\n\nThe benefits of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) **include improved emotional regulation, reduced psychological distress, and enhanced psychological flexibility**. It helps individuals regulate their emotions more effectively, leading to reduced psychological distress and improved coping strategies. A discussion about a similar topic with the Cleveland Clinic indicates that ACT is effective in treating various mental health conditions, contributing to better mental clarity and overall quality of life.\n\nThe therapy also enhances mindfulness, allowing individuals to stay present and engage fully in their lives despite challenges. In chronic pain management, ACT has been found to improve quality of life by promoting acceptance of pain while encouraging value-driven actions. ACT fosters resilience by helping individuals build a stronger connection with their values, resulting in greater motivation and life satisfaction. These benefits make ACT a valuable intervention for a wide range of psychological and emotional challenges.\n\n### Rediscover Life at Right Choice Recovery\n\nGet the compassionate health support you deserve.

ACT reduces pain-related distress and improves quality of life by encouraging acceptance and mindfulness techniques. It is also applied in conditions such as diabetes, cancer, and cardiovascular diseases to support emotional well-being and adherence to treatment plans. ACT enhances overall health outcomes by addressing both the psychological and behavioral aspects of chronic illness management.\n\n### Can Acceptance and Commitment Therapy Be Used With Children?\n\n**Yes, Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) can be used with children by adapting its techniques to suit their developmental level.** ACT helps children manage difficult emotions and thoughts through simplified strategies such as storytelling, imaginative play, and mindfulness exercises. Techniques like “thought balloons,” where children visualize letting go of negative thoughts, and values-based activities, such as identifying what matters most through games, make ACT engaging and accessible. ACT effectively supports children in managing anxiety, stress, and behavioral challenges by fostering emotional resilience and psychological flexibility.\n\n## What Are Common ACT Exercises and Activities?\n\nCommon Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) exercises and activities include **Mindful Journaling, Thought Distancing Exercises, Leaves on a Stream Exercise, Values Clarification Worksheet, Body Scan Meditation, and Acceptance Statements** that help individuals develop psychological flexibility and align their actions with their values. These common ACT exercises include:\n\n* **Mindful Journaling:** Writing thoughts and emotions without judgment to increase self-awareness and acceptance.\n* **Thought Distancing Exercises:** Observing thoughts as external objects, such as imagining them as passing clouds or leaves floating down a stream, to reduce their influence.\n* **Leaves on a Stream Exercise:** Visualizing thoughts as leaves drifting down a river, helping individuals detach from intrusive thoughts and stay present. According to Harris, R. (2009). In his study “ACT made simple” published by New Harbinger Publications found that Practitioners incorporate Leaves on a Stream method to assist clients in observing their thoughts without attachment, potentially aiding in emotional regulation and present-moment awareness.\n* **Values Clarification Worksheet:** Listing and ranking core values to provide direction and motivation for meaningful actions.\n* **Body Scan Meditation:** Focusing on physical sensations to cultivate present-moment awareness and reduce stress. Body scan meditation aids in managing chronic pain by increasing awareness and acceptance of pain, which leads to an improved outlook and quality of life.\n* **Acceptance Statements:** Repeating affirmations like “I am experiencing this feeling, and that’s okay” to encourage emotional openness.\n\nThese exercises support emotional regulation, resilience, and personal growth by encouraging mindfulness and acceptance.\n\n## What Does an ACT Session Involve?\n\nAn Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) session involves **a structured approach designed to help individuals develop psychological flexibility and align their actions with their values.** Sessions begin with a check-in, where clients discuss their thoughts, emotions, and any challenges they have encountered since the previous session. This is followed by a mindfulness exercise to help clients stay present and cultivate awareness of their experiences without judgment.\n\nThe therapist then guides the client through values clarification exercises to identify what matters most and explore how their actions align with these values. Cognitive defusion techniques are introduced to help clients detach from unhelpful thoughts, and acceptance strategies are used to encourage openness to difficult emotions. Each session concludes with goal setting, where clients commit to specific, values-based actions to implement between sessions, fostering long-term behavioral change.\n\n## Are you covered for treatment?\n\nRight Choice Recovery is an approved provider for Blue Cross Blue Shield and Cigna, while also accepting many other major insurance carriers.\n\n[Check Coverage Now!](https://rightchoicerecoverynj.com/insurance-verification/)\n\n## How Effective is Acceptance and Commitment Therapy?\n\nAcceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) is 95% effective. A 2023 meta-analysis published in Annals of General Psychiatry entitled “Effect of acceptance and commitment therapy for depressive disorders: a meta-analysis”, evaluated the impact of ACT on depressive disorders, revealing a significant reduction in depressive symptoms with a standardized mean difference (SMD) of -1.05 (95% CI: -1.43 to -0.66, P < 0.00001). This indicates a substantial effect size in favor of ACT for treating depression.\n\nIt is an evidence-based approach proven to be effective in treating various psychological conditions, including anxiety, depression, and chronic pain. Studies indicate that ACT helps improve psychological flexibility, with significant reductions in symptoms of anxiety and depression by up to 30%. When compared to traditional cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), ACT is equally effective, particularly in addressing chronic conditions where emotional avoidance plays a key role. ACT has demonstrated positive outcomes in enhancing quality of life and reducing stress in individuals with chronic illnesses. These findings support ACT’s growing recognition as a reliable and impactful therapeutic intervention.\n\n### How Long Does ACT Take?\n\nAcceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) takes a period of 8 to 16 weeks, with weekly sessions lasting about 50 to 60 minutes, according to a study named “ Acceptance and Commitment Therapy for Depression” from The Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences.\n\nThe duration varies based on factors such as the severity of the individual’s issues, their commitment to practicing ACT techniques, and the complexity of their goals. Some individuals experience significant improvements within a few sessions, while others require ongoing support for long-term progress.\n\n## What Are the Limitations of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy?\n\nThe limitations of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) **are Limited Evidence for Severe Mental Illnesses, Suitability Concerns, Adherence Challenges, and Therapist Variability**. The limited evidence supporting its efficacy for individuals with severe mental illnesses such as schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. While ACT has shown promise in managing symptoms, it is not sufficient as a standalone treatment for individuals requiring intensive psychiatric care or medication management. ACT’s emphasis on acceptance and mindfulness is not suitable for individuals who prefer structured, symptom-focused approaches such as traditional cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT).\n\nAnother challenge with ACT is adherence to its techniques, as the therapy requires consistent practice of mindfulness and acceptance strategies outside of therapy sessions. Some individuals find it difficult to engage with abstract concepts such as cognitive defusion and self-as-context, which impact treatment outcomes. Furthermore, the effectiveness of ACT relies heavily on the therapist’s skill in guiding clients through experiential exercises, meaning that variability in therapist training and experience affects treatment success. These limitations highlight the importance of considering individual preferences and needs when choosing ACT as a therapeutic approach.\n\n### Who Should Not Use Acceptance and Commitment Therapy?\n\nAcceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) is **not suitable for individuals with severe cognitive impairments, as the therapy requires cognitive engagement and the ability to reflect on thoughts and emotions.** It is also less effective for individuals experiencing acute psychiatric conditions, such as psychosis, that require immediate medical intervention. ACT is not ideal for clients who are unmotivated or unwilling to engage in self-reflective practices, as the therapy relies on active participation and commitment to value-based actions.\n\n### What Are the Common Criticisms of ACT?\n\nThe common criticisms of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) include **its lack of structured treatment protocols, which make it challenging to standardize and measure outcomes across different populations.** Additionally, there is limited long-term research compared to more established therapies like cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). However, proponents of ACT highlight its flexibility in addressing diverse psychological conditions and point to growing evidence supporting its effectiveness in improving psychological flexibility and quality of life. ACT’s efficacy across various mental health concerns, reinforces its value as an evidence-based intervention.\n\nDid you know most health insurance plans cover substance use disorder treatment?

It is important to look for therapists who are licensed mental health professionals and have completed ACT-specific training or certifications. Several online resources and directories help identify qualified practitioners. When evaluating potential therapists, consider their experience, approach, and client reviews to ensure they align with your needs.\n\n**Resources to Find a Qualified ACT Therapist:**\n\n* **Professional Directories:** Websites such as the Association for Contextual Behavioral Science (ACBS) and Psychology Today offer searchable directories of ACT-trained therapists.\n* **Certifications:** Look for therapists with ACT-specific training or credentials from reputable institutions or organizations.\n* **Referrals:** Ask healthcare providers, support groups, or friends for recommendations.\n* **Online Reviews:** Check client feedback and testimonials to gauge the therapist’s effectiveness and approach.\n* **Initial Consultation:** Schedule a session to discuss your goals and assess whether their style aligns with your preferences.\n\n### How Much Does ACT Therapy Cost?\n\nThe cost of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) ranges from $100 to $250 per session, depending on factors such as location, therapist experience, and session length. In larger cities, fees are higher, while in smaller towns or rural areas, they tend to be lower. Some therapists offer sliding scale fees based on income, and ACT therapy is partially or fully covered by insurance plans if provided by a licensed mental health professional.\n\n## How is ACT Different from Other Therapies?\n\nAcceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) differs from [Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)](https://rightchoicerecoverynj.com/addiction/therapy/cbt/) in **its approach to thoughts and emotions.** CBT is a goal-oriented therapy that helps individuals recognize cognitive distortions and develop healthier thinking patterns. While CBT focuses on identifying and challenging negative thought patterns to reduce symptoms, ACT emphasizes accepting thoughts and feelings without judgment while committing to value-driven actions.\n\nCBT aims to change unhelpful thought patterns through cognitive restructuring, whereas ACT encourages cognitive defusion—distancing oneself from thoughts rather than changing them. Additionally, ACT places a strong emphasis on mindfulness and values clarification, which helps individuals live in alignment with their core beliefs rather than solely focusing on symptom reduction.\n\nCompared to [Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT)](https://rightchoicerecoverynj.com/addiction/therapy/dbt/), a form of CBT, ACT focuses more on psychological flexibility, whereas DBT emphasizes emotional regulation and interpersonal effectiveness. DBT is structured around specific skill-building modules, including distress tolerance and emotional regulation, which are particularly beneficial for individuals with borderline personality disorder and emotional dysregulation.\n\nIn contrast, ACT’s approach is more flexible and centers on accepting distressing emotions rather than attempting to regulate or change them. While both therapies incorporate mindfulness practices, ACT applies mindfulness to foster acceptance and commitment, whereas DBT uses it to build emotional awareness and distress tolerance.\n\nPublished On January 31, 2025 | Last Updated: March 25, 2025\n\n[Editorial Policy](https://rightchoicerecoverynj.com/policies/editorial-standards/)\n\nShare This Post\n\n\n\n## Right Choice Recovery Editorial Team\n\nThe Right Choice Recovery Editorial Team, based in Dayton, NJ, is dedicated to providing accurate and insightful information on addiction treatment and mental health.

When you’re fused with a thought, it can feel like your identity. This mental process reduces psychological flexibility, making it harder to respond to life’s challenges in a healthy and values-driven way. [...] Rather than ruminating about a thought until you feel miserable or allowing one of these stray unhelpful thoughts to influence your behavior, Acceptance and Commitment Therapy teaches us cognitive defusion techniques to have the thought without becoming fused to it. Rather than trying to eliminate the thought (which is impossible) or fighting with the thought (which is itself miserable), the trick in cognitive defusion is to see the thought as merely a thought and let go of struggling with it. [...] Defusion is really about changing our relationship to our thoughts by observing them rather than engaging them. According to Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, it’s not the thoughts that are the problem; it’s what you do with them.\n\nWhen we work with our therapy clients using Acceptance and Commitment therapy, we make use of metaphors to help people understand what cognitive defusion is. Here are some of the metaphors we might use in therapy:\nRaw Content: # [Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Los Angeles](/)\n\n\n\n[Albert Bonfil, PsyD](/cbt-blog?author=51e36ea9e4b0e2abc3eb9d0e)\n\n# [Cognitive Defusion Techniques and Exercises](/cbt-blog/cognitive-defusion-techniques-and-exercises)\n\n[Albert Bonfil, PsyD](/cbt-blog?author=51e36ea9e4b0e2abc3eb9d0e)\n\n# What is Cognitive Defusion?\n\nDo you experience negative thoughts? If you have a brain, the answer is almost certainly yes. In fact, research indicates that up to 80% of our thoughts may be negative. That’s a staggering number — so why aren’t we all overwhelmed by depression and anxiety all the time? The reason is that, in most situations, we're able to distinguish between helpful and unhelpful thoughts and filter them accordingly. When negative thinking starts to interfere with our well-being, there are several effective CBT interventions that can help. Two of the most widely used [CBT interventions](https://cogbtherapy.com/cognitive-behavioral-therapy-exercises) are identifying [CBT cognitive distortions](https://cogbtherapy.com/cbt-for-cognitive-distortions) and engaging in [cognitive reappraisal](https://cogbtherapy.com/cbt-blog/2014/5/4/hhy104os08dekc537dlw7nvopzyi44).\n\n### **In This Guide**\n\n[**What is Cognitive Fusion?**](#What-is-cognitive-fusion)\n\n[**What is Cognitive Defusion?**](#what-is-cognitive-defusion)\n\n[**How Cognitive Defusion Works**](#how-does-cognitive-defusion-work)\n\n[**Cognitive Defusion Exercises**](#cognitive-defusion-exercises)\n\n[**Benefits of Cognitive Defusion**](#benefits-of-cognitive-defusion)\n\n[**Get Help**](#get-help)\n\n## What is Cognitive Fusion in Acceptance and Commitment Therapy?\n\nIn [Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT)](/acceptance-and-commitment-therapy-act-los-angeles), cognitive fusion refers to the tendency to become overly entangled with your thoughts — especially negative or self-critical thoughts — as if they are literal truths. When you’re fused with a thought, it can feel like your identity. This mental process reduces psychological flexibility, making it harder to respond to life’s challenges in a healthy and values-driven way.\n\nFor instance, if you frequently think, “I’m unlovable” or “I’m not good enough,” and you let those thoughts control your behavior — like deleting your dating profile even though you want a relationship — that’s a classic example of cognitive fusion. Instead of seeing the thought as just a passing mental event, it becomes your reality.\n\nCognitive fusion plays a central role in many mental health struggles, including anxiety, depression, low self-esteem, and social withdrawal. ACT therapy helps individuals build distance from negative thoughts, allowing them to take action based on their values rather than being controlled by their inner critic.\n\n## What is Cognitive Defusion?\n\n**Cognitive defusion** is the process of loosening the grip of thinking on identity, promoting psychological flexibility by creating distance from thoughts and fostering mindful observation. Cognitive defusion facilitates a more objective perspective on thoughts, empowering individuals to relate to their mental processes with greater openness and adaptability, key elements in achieving psychological flexibility.\n\n### **Cognitive defusion in ACT is:**\n\n* **Encouraging an objective examination of thoughts instead of immersion in them.**\n* **Cultivating the skill to observe thoughts without becoming entangled.**\n* **Embracing a mindset that allows thoughts to naturally come and go, without the need to grasp or cling to them.**\n\nRather than ruminating about a thought until you feel miserable or allowing one of these stray unhelpful thoughts to influence your behavior, Acceptance and Commitment Therapy teaches us cognitive defusion techniques to have the thought without becoming fused to it. Rather than trying to eliminate the thought (which is impossible) or fighting with the thought (which is itself miserable), the trick in cognitive defusion is to see the thought as *merely a thought* and let go of struggling with it. Cognitive defusion is often a central component in [CBT for anxiety](https://cogbtherapy.com/anxiety-los-angeles) as well as [CBT for Depression](https://cogbtherapy.com/depression-los-angeles).\n\n## How Does Cognitive Defusion Work?\n\nCognitive defusion techniques derive from mindfulness practices designed to detach from the content of the mind. Rather than seeing the world through distorted or unhelpful thinking, defusion is about seeing the thoughts themselves. Watching the thoughts, not watching the world *through the thoughts*.\n\nCognitive defusion is similar to hearing a radio playing in the other room when you’re reading a book. If you’re engrossed in the book, you’ll definitely *hear* the radio, but you won’t be *listening* to it. That’s similar to the experience of defusing from a thought. You know it’s there. You haven’t gotten rid of it. But you don’t get hooked by it. You allow thoughts to come and go without being overwhelmed by them.\n\nDefusion is really about changing our relationship to our thoughts by observing them rather than engaging them. According to Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, it’s not the thoughts that are the problem; it’s what you do with them.\n\nWhen we work with our therapy clients using Acceptance and Commitment therapy, we make use of metaphors to help people understand what cognitive defusion is. Here are some of the metaphors we might use in therapy:\n\n* *Watching a river from the banks rather than being caught in the current.*\n* *Getting unhooked by a thought that has hooked you.*\n* *Noticing thoughts coming and going like noticing clouds drifting through the sky.*\n\n## Cognitive Defusion Exercises\n\n### Notice It\n\nWhen you notice you’ve been hooked by a thought, such as “That thing I said was so stupid,” unhook by taking a step back from the thought and say or think to yourself:\n\n“*I’m noticing a thought* *that* what I said was stupid.”\n\nTake another step back and think to yourself:\n\n*I’m noticing I’m just having a thought that* what I said was stupid.”\n\nTake an even further step back by thinking to yourself:\n\n“*I notice I’m having just another thought about* being stupid,” or even further back with “*I’m noticing I’m having just another judgment*.”\n\nThe effect of this intervention can be likened to watching a 3D IMAX movie in the front row: It’s hard not to feel your heart pounding during action sequences. But when you move to the back of the theater and take off your 3D glasses, it’s not nearly as triggering or compelling.\n\n### Slow It Down\n\nUsing the same unhelpful thought from above, imagine hearing the thought on a record player that is about to stop. Slow down the thought until the words are just a series of sounds: “Thhhhhhhh – aaaaaaaaat thhhhhhhhhh-iiiiiiiiiii-nnnnnnnnnnnng Iiiiiiiiiiiiiiii ssssssssssss-aiiiiiiiiiiiiiiid waaaaaaaaaaaaa-ssssssssssss sssssssssst-uuuuuuuuuuu-pppppppppppp-iiiiiiiiiiiiiid.”  \n Hard to read? It’s even harder to think. By slowing down the thought, you stop struggling not to have it and instead change how you’re thinking it, loosening your attachment to the content.\n\n### Sing It\n\nTo the tune of Happy Birthday or any other song-- the goofier, the better. Singing doesn’t get rid of the thought. Remember, that’s not possible. Singing the thought helps you change your relationship to it. You still have it, but it’s no longer in charge. You are.\n\n### Thank Your Mind\n\nWhenever an unhelpful thought rears its head, rather than getting hooked by it or trying to suppress it, *thank your mind for having the thought*. After all, negative thoughts are there to help you avoid problems; they’re just not always terribly effective at it. “Thank you, mind!”\n\n### Goofy Voice\n\nImagine, or better yet, say the unhelpful thought in a goofy voice. See how seriously you take your mind when it’s jabbering on like Donald Duck or Bugs Bunny.\n\n### Smile at the Thought\n\nRather than spending all of your mental energy battling the thought, make peace with it by smiling at it but not engaging with it. You can use the [half smile](https://cogbtherapy.com/cbt-blog/2013/07/turn-that-mood-upside-down-with.html) technique with this exercise.\n\n## Benefits of Cognitive Defusion\n\nThis technique can be used to help with numerous psychological problems. Cognitive defusion is found in [CBT for social anxiety](https://cogbtherapy.com/cbt-for-social-anxiety-disorder), [CBT for self-esteem](https://cogbtherapy.com/cbt-for-improving-low-confidence), and [CBT for GAD](https://cogbtherapy.com/generalized-anxiety-disorder-treatment) (Generalized Anxiety Disorder), to name a few. In our therapy practice, we have found that practicing these cognitive defusion skills regularly whenever we become fused to an unhelpful thought, eventually, we develop a profound understanding that thoughts are merely thoughts, not reality.\n\nAs we develop familiarity with this idea, we become more and more able to let unhelpful thoughts go, defusing from them when they arise, eventually no longer needing cognitive defusion techniques at all. By learning to see thoughts as thoughts rather than reasons to suffer, we shrug them off and get on with our lives. We are able to do what matters most, even when our thoughts tell us otherwise. In our therapy work, we find cognitive defusion most effective when combined with other [cognitive behavioral therapy techniques](https://cogbtherapy.com/cognitive-behavior-therapy-techniques).\n\nLearn more: Cognitive Defusion in [Acceptance and Commitment Therapy](https://cogbtherapy.com/acceptance-and-commitment-therapy-act-los-angeles).\n\nIf you think you or someone you know would benefit from working with a professional using cognitive defusion or any of the other interventions from ACT or cognitive-behavioral therapy, click the links below to learn more or schedule a consultation.\n\n[Learn more](https://cogbtherapy.com/contact-us)\n\n[Schedule a Free Consultation](https://cogbtherapy.com/contact-us)\n\nCopyright © Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Los Angeles, 2022\n\nMake a change today. Call (888) 813-9613 for more information or to schedule an appointment.

Unlike traditional cognitive-behavioral therapies (CBT), which often focus on altering maladaptive thoughts and behaviors, ACT encourages the acceptance of negative thoughts and emotions while fostering a commitment to personal values. This review explores ACT's effectiveness in promoting psychological well-being (PWB) by encompassing emotional, psychological, and social dimensions. Key aspects of PWB include emotional regulation, life satisfaction, and the reduction of experiential avoidance. The theoretical foundations of ACT are based on relational frame theory (RFT), which addresses cognitive fusion and experiential avoidance as central contributors to psychological distress. Extensive research, including meta-analyses and randomized controlled trials (RCTs), supports ACT's efficacy in treating various psychological issues and improving PWB. Despite strong empirical support, several gaps remain, including the need for more longitudinal studies, the exploration of cultural adaptability, and research on specific populations. Recommendations for future research include examining the long-term effects of ACT, its application across diverse cultural contexts, and its efficacy among underrepresented groups. This review underscores ACT's potential as a versatile therapeutic approach, providing valuable insights for mental health professionals and researchers.\n\n**Keywords:** acceptance and commitment therapy (act), mindfulness, psychological flexibility (pf), psychological well-being (pwb), values-based action\n\n## Introduction and background\n\nAcceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) represents a modern and evidence-based psychological intervention aimed at enhancing psychological flexibility and overall well-being. Psychological flexibility, the cornerstone of ACT, refers to an individual's ability to remain open to their experiences, stay present at the moment, and engage in actions aligned with personal values, even when faced with emotional or cognitive discomfort [[1](#REF1)]. This capacity is vital for maintaining mental health, enabling individuals to navigate life's challenges with resilience and purpose.\n\nACT was developed in the late 1980s by psychologist Steven C. Hayes and his colleagues as an evolution of behavior analysis and contextual behavioral science [[2](#REF2)]. Rooted in the principles of relational frame theory (RFT), a behavioral account of human language and cognition, ACT diverged from traditional behavioral therapies by integrating acceptance and mindfulness techniques with behavior change strategies [[3](#REF3)]. Hayes introduced ACT to address limitations he observed in existing cognitive and behavioral therapies, particularly their focus on symptom reduction rather than broader life enhancement [[4](#REF4)].\n\nUnlike traditional cognitive-behavioral therapies (CBT), which primarily aim to identify and restructure maladaptive thoughts, ACT emphasizes accepting these thoughts and emotions without judgment. Through mindfulness, individuals learn to observe their internal experiences with curiosity and openness rather than attempting to control or avoid them [[5](#REF5)]. Simultaneously, ACT encourages commitment to actions guided by personal values, fostering a life of meaning and purpose. This unique combination of acceptance and values-driven behavior distinguishes ACT from other therapeutic modalities and provides a powerful framework for achieving psychological well-being (PWB).\n\nThe historical evolution of ACT reflects its foundation in both clinical practice and empirical research. Over the past three decades, ACT has been rigorously tested through randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and meta-analyses, demonstrating its efficacy across various psychological conditions, including anxiety, depression, and chronic pain [[6](#REF6),[7](#REF7)]. The therapy's core principles are as follows: acceptance, mindfulness, cognitive defusion, values clarification, and committed action, a flexible approach that can be tailored to diverse populations and settings, making ACT a versatile and widely applicable therapeutic option [[8](#REF8)].\n\nAs psychological therapies continue to evolve, there is a growing need to synthesize the extensive body of research on ACT to provide a comprehensive understanding of its mechanisms, applications, and long-term benefits. This narrative review aims to address this gap by analyzing current studies, exploring the unique aspects of ACT that contribute to psychological well-being, and discussing its implications for mental health professionals and researchers.\n\n## Review\n\nOverview of psychological well-being\n\nPsychological well-being (PWB) is a multifaceted construct encompassing various dimensions of human functioning. It goes beyond the mere absence of mental disorders, including emotional, psychological, and social components that contribute to overall life satisfaction and quality of life. Understanding these components is essential for developing effective interventions such as ACT, which aims to enhance PWB [[9](#REF9)].\n\nEmotional Well-Being\n\nEmotional well-being includes the experience of positive emotions and moods, such as happiness, joy, and contentment, as well as the absence of negative emotions such as sadness, anger, and anxiety. This dimension reflects an individual's general affective state and significantly contributes to overall life satisfaction [[10](#REF10)]. Individuals with high emotional well-being tend to experience frequent positive emotions, which can buffer against stress and enhance overall mental health.\n\nPsychological Functioning\n\nPsychological functioning is characterized by self-acceptance, autonomy, environmental mastery, and personal growth. Self-acceptance refers to a positive attitude toward oneself and one's past experiences, acknowledging strengths and weaknesses. Autonomy involves the ability to make independent decisions and exercise self-determination. Environmental mastery denotes managing one's life and surroundings effectively, creating contexts that align with personal needs and values. Personal growth represents the continuous development and realization of one's potential, an ongoing process of self-improvement and adaptation to life's challenges [[11](#REF11)].\n\nSocial Well-Being\n\nSocial well-being pertains to the quality of an individual's relationships and social roles. It encompasses feelings of belongingness, social integration, and the quality of interactions with others. Social well-being is crucial for creating a sense of community and connectedness, for overall well-being. Strong social connections are associated with numerous health benefits, including lower rates of morbidity and mortality, highlighting the importance of fostering positive social interactions [[12](#REF12)].\n\nUnderstanding PWB is critical as it significantly influences overall health, resilience, and quality of life. Individuals with high levels of PWB are better equipped to handle life's adversities and are more likely to experience positive health outcomes, including a reduced risk of chronic illnesses and greater longevity [[13](#REF13)]. Additionally, PWB plays a vital role in promoting mental health, making it a key focus for therapeutic interventions such as ACT.\n\nTheoretical foundations of ACT\n\nACT is rooted in relational frame theory (RFT), a comprehensive psychological framework that explores how human suffering often arises from the processes of language and cognition. RFT suggests that individuals form intricate networks of associations between words and concepts, leading to a phenomenon known as cognitive fusion. Cognitive fusion occurs when individuals perceive their thoughts as literal truths rather than recognizing them as transient mental events. For example, a person might internalize the thought \"I am a failure\" and treat it as an absolute reality [[2](#REF2)]. This fusion can result in experiential avoidance, where individuals strive to evade or escape unpleasant thoughts, emotions, and sensations. Paradoxically, such avoidance can intensify psychological distress and hinder one's ability to engage fully in life [[1](#REF1)].\n\nACT promotes six fundamental processes that collectively enhance psychological flexibility: acceptance, cognitive defusion, being present, self-as-context, values, and committed action. These processes are interrelated and work synergistically to help individuals lead a more meaningful and fulfilling life\n\nAcceptance\n\nAcceptance involves embracing all thoughts and emotions, including uncomfortable ones, as an inherent part of the human experience. This process encourages individuals to open up to their internal experiences rather than resisting or avoiding them, fostering a more adaptive and compassionate stance toward oneself [[1](#REF1)].\n\nCognitive Defusion\n\nCognitive defusion refers to the creation of psychological distance from one's thoughts, helping individuals perceive thoughts as passing events rather than concrete truths. Cognitive defusion techniques, such as mindfulness and metaphor, aid in reducing the impact of unhelpful thoughts on behavior, allowing for greater flexibility in responding to various situations [[1](#REF1)].\n\nBeing Present\n\nBeing present emphasizes maintaining a nonjudgmental awareness of the present moment, which can reduce rumination and alleviate anxiety. Mindfulness practices are central to this process, encouraging individuals to focus on their current experiences and engage fully with the present [[1](#REF1)].\n\nSelf-as-Context\n\nThis approach involves understanding that one's identity is distinct from thoughts and feelings, fostering a stable sense of self amidst changing internal experiences. This perspective helps individuals maintain a consistent sense of self-identity, even as their thoughts and emotions fluctuate [[1](#REF1)].\n\nValues Clarification\n\nThis entails identifying what is truly important to an individual and aligning actions with these personal values. This process provides direction and purpose, helping individuals prioritize meaningful activities and pursue goals that align with their core beliefs [[1](#REF1)].\n\nCommitted Action\n\nCommitted action encourages taking concrete steps toward goals that are consistent with one's values, promoting perseverance and adaptability. Committed action involves setting specific, values-driven goals and pursuing them despite obstacles, thereby enhancing overall life satisfaction and achievement [[1](#REF1)].\n\nThese six core processes form the foundation of ACT and are essential for cultivating psychological flexibility. They provide a comprehensive framework for individuals to navigate life's challenges more effectively, fostering a more adaptive and fulfilling life [[3](#REF3)].\n\nEffectiveness of ACT\n\nACT's effectiveness has been extensively studied, with numerous randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and meta-analyses demonstrating its efficacy across various psychological conditions. A meta-analysis conducted by A-Tjak et al. (2015) reviewed multiple RCTs and found that ACT had moderate to large effects in reducing symptoms of anxiety, depression, and stress [[6](#REF6)]. Recent trials highlight its impact in educational and workplace contexts, underscoring its role in improving adolescents' well-being and fostering workplace resilience [[14](#REF14)-[16](#REF16)]. Moreover, psychological flexibility has emerged as a key mechanism mediating stress and well-being. This evidence highlights ACT's utility in clinical settings and in promoting general well-being among non-clinical populations [[16](#REF16)].\n\nAnother significant study by Fledderus et al. (2012) explored the impact of a self-help intervention based on ACT within a general population. The study revealed significant improvements in psychological flexibility, mindfulness, and life satisfaction. The participants reported a reduction in psychological distress, further underscoring ACT's potential to enhance PWB [[5](#REF5)].\n\nAdditionally, a comparative study by Forman et al. (2007) evaluated ACT alongside traditional CBT for treating anxiety and depression. Both therapies effectively reduced symptoms, but ACT participants demonstrated greater acceptance and engagement in valued activities [[17](#REF17)]. This suggests that ACT offers additional benefits beyond traditional therapies, particularly in promoting values-driven behavior and enhancing the overall quality of life.\n\nBenefits of ACT for psychological well-being\n\nAcceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) offers numerous benefits for psychological well-being (PWB), making it a valuable therapeutic approach for a wide range of individuals. Its core principles, acceptance, mindfulness, and commitment to values, are particularly effective in fostering mental health and enhancing the overall quality of life. Below are key ways in which ACT contributes to PWB.\n\nPsychological Flexibility\n\nOne of the central goals of ACT is to cultivate psychological flexibility, which involves being open to a range of experiences and acting in ways consistent with one's values. This flexibility enables individuals to adapt to various life situations, reducing the impact of rigid thinking patterns and promoting overall mental health [[9](#REF9)]. By fostering an open and accepting stance toward internal experiences, ACT helps individuals navigate life's challenges more effectively, leading to improved psychological well-being.\n\nEmotional Regulation\n\nACT teaches acceptance and mindfulness techniques that help individuals manage their emotions more constructively. By acknowledging and accepting emotions rather than suppressing them, individuals can reduce the intensity and duration of negative emotional states. This process decreases distress and enhances emotional regulation, leading to a more balanced and fulfilling life [[18](#REF18)]. The focus on emotional acceptance allows individuals to experience a broader range of emotions without becoming overwhelmed by them.\n\nLife Satisfaction\n\nA key aspect of ACT is aligning one's actions with personal values, which fosters a sense of purpose and direction. This alignment enhances life satisfaction by encouraging individuals to engage in meaningful activities and pursue goals that are truly important to them. The emphasis on values-driven behavior helps individuals find joy and accomplishment in their daily lives, even amidst challenges [[5](#REF5)]. By focusing on what truly matters, individuals can achieve a greater sense of accomplishment and contentment. Studies integrating creative and artistic practices with ACT have shown promise in addressing grief and trauma, further broadening its applications [[19](#REF19)].\n\nReduction of Experiential Avoidance\n\nExperiential avoidance, or the tendency to evade unpleasant thoughts and feelings, is a common source of psychological distress. ACT directly addresses this issue by promoting acceptance of all experiences, including negative ones. This approach reduces avoidance behaviors that often exacerbate mental health issues, facilitating psychological growth and resilience [[8](#REF8)]. By embracing a more open and accepting attitude toward uncomfortable experiences, individuals can reduce the negative impact of avoidance on their lives.\n\nLong-Term Benefits\n\nThe benefits of ACT extend beyond immediate symptom relief. Research has shown that ACT's positive effects, such as increased psychological flexibility and improved emotional regulation, persist over time. These lasting benefits equip individuals with tools to navigate future psychological challenges, making ACT a valuable long-term investment in mental health [[8](#REF8)]. The skills and strategies learned in ACT can be applied to various life situations, making it a versatile and enduring therapeutic approach [[8](#REF8)].\n\nLiterature support for ACT and psychological well-being\n\nResearch supports the efficacy of ACT in enhancing psychological well-being. For instance, a meta-analysis by A-Tjak et al. (2015) found that ACT significantly reduces symptoms of anxiety, depression, and stress while also promoting life satisfaction and emotional regulation. This comprehensive review of the literature provides strong evidence for ACT's effectiveness across a wide range of psychological issues [[6](#REF6)].\n\nFurther studies, such as those by Fledderus et al. (2012) [[5](#REF5)] and Kashdan and Rottenberg (2010) [[18](#REF18)], highlight ACT's role in enhancing psychological flexibility and adaptive emotional regulation strategies. These studies demonstrate that ACT reduces psychological symptoms and promotes positive mental health outcomes, making it a valuable therapeutic approach for individuals seeking to improve their well-being [[5](#REF5),[18](#REF18)].\n\nClinical trials, such as those conducted by Forman et al. (2007), have confirmed ACT's effectiveness in treating depressive symptoms and encouraging engagement in valued activities. These findings collectively underscore the importance of ACT as a therapeutic approach for improving PWB and addressing a range of psychological issues. The evidence suggests that ACT's unique focus on acceptance, mindfulness, and values-driven living offers significant benefits for individuals experiencing a wide range of psychological challenges [[17](#REF17)].\n\nACT's emphasis on acceptance, mindfulness, and values-based living makes it a crucial intervention for enhancing psychological well-being. By promoting psychological flexibility, emotional regulation, life satisfaction, and resilience, ACT provides individuals with essential skills for navigating life's complexities. Its evidence-based effectiveness and long-term benefits make it a highly recommended approach for those seeking to improve their mental health and overall quality of life.\n\nIdentified gaps in the literature\n\nDespite the evidence supporting ACT, several gaps remain in the existing literature. First, there is a paucity of longitudinal studies examining the long-term effects of ACT on PWB. Understanding the durability of these effects over extended periods is crucial for determining the therapy's long-term efficacy. Such studies would provide valuable insights into how ACT's benefits persist over time and whether additional interventions are needed to maintain these effects.\n\nSecond, there is limited research on the application of ACT across diverse cultural contexts. Cultural differences can significantly influence psychological processes, making it essential to explore how ACT can be adapted to various cultural backgrounds. This exploration would help ensure that ACT is effective and culturally sensitive across different populations, addressing the unique needs and values of individuals from diverse cultural settings.\n\nThird, more studies are needed to determine ACT's efficacy in specific populations, such as adolescents, older adults, and individuals with chronic illnesses. These groups may face unique psychological challenges that require tailored interventions. Research focusing on these populations would provide a more comprehensive understanding of ACT's applicability and effectiveness, helping to refine and adapt the therapy for different age groups and health conditions.\n\nThese identified gaps highlight the need for further research to expand the understanding of ACT's applicability and effectiveness. Addressing these gaps will provide a more comprehensive view of how ACT can be utilized across different populations and settings, ensuring that it remains a versatile and effective therapeutic approach.\n\nSuggestions for future research\n\nFuture research should focus on conducting longitudinal studies to assess the long-term impact of ACT on PWB. Such studies would provide valuable insights into the sustainability of ACT's benefits and its effectiveness over extended periods. By tracking individuals' progress over time, researchers can better understand how ACT's core processes contribute to lasting improvements in psychological well-being.\n\nAdditionally, exploring the cultural adaptability of ACT is crucial, as cultural norms and values can affect therapy outcomes. Researchers should investigate how ACT can be modified to accommodate cultural differences, ensuring that the therapy is relevant and effective for individuals from diverse backgrounds. This research could involve collaborating with practitioners from different cultural contexts to develop culturally sensitive ACT interventions.\n\nResearchers should also focus on underrepresented groups, including adolescents, older adults, and those with chronic conditions, to provide a more comprehensive understanding of ACT's applicability. These populations may have unique psychological needs that require specialized approaches. For example, adolescents may benefit from interventions that address developmental issues, while older adults may require support for age-related challenges. Research in these areas would help tailor ACT to meet the specific needs of these groups.\n\nFinally, developing standardized measures to evaluate the outcomes of ACT interventions, including broader aspects of PWB such as life satisfaction and social functioning, would offer a more holistic evaluation of the therapy's effectiveness. These measures could help researchers and practitioners assess the full range of ACT's benefits, providing a more comprehensive understanding of how the therapy impacts individuals' lives.\n\nBy addressing these areas, future research can contribute to the refinement and expansion of ACT, ensuring that it remains a versatile and effective therapeutic approach across various contexts and populations. This research would help solidify ACT's place in the broader field of psychological therapies, providing evidence for its efficacy and adaptability.\n\nDespite the evidence supporting ACT, gaps remain, particularly regarding its cultural adaptability and application in developmental transitions [[20](#REF20)]. Future research should address these issues to maximize ACT's impact across diverse populations.\n\n## Conclusions\n\nAcceptance and commitment therapy offers a robust framework for enhancing psychological well-being through its unique focus on acceptance, mindfulness, and values-driven living. Empirical evidence supports its effectiveness across various psychological disorders and general mental health concerns. As ACT continues to evolve, its applications in diverse cultural and clinical settings are likely to expand, providing a valuable tool for promoting mental health and well-being.\n\nBy fostering psychological flexibility and encouraging values-driven actions, ACT helps individuals navigate life's challenges with greater resilience and satisfaction. The therapy's unique focus on acceptance and mindfulness distinguishes it from other therapeutic approaches, making it a valuable tool for enhancing PWB in clinical and non-clinical populations. As research continues to explore and refine ACT, its potential to improve the quality of life for individuals facing a wide range of psychological challenges will likely grow. Overall, ACT's emphasis on living in alignment with one's values and accepting all aspects of the human experience offers a holistic approach to mental health. Its evidence-based techniques and long-term benefits make it a highly recommended approach for those seeking to enhance their psychological well-being and overall quality of life. As the field of psychology advances, ACT is poised to remain a critical component of therapeutic practice, offering hope and healing to those in need.\n\n## Disclosures\n\n**Conflicts of interest:** In compliance with the ICMJE uniform disclosure form, all authors declare the following:\n\n**Payment/services info:** All authors have declared that no financial support was received from any organization for the submitted work.\n\n**Financial relationships:** All authors have declared that they have no financial relationships at present or within the previous three years with any organizations that might have an interest in the submitted work.\n\n**Other relationships:** All authors have declared that there are no other relationships or activities that could appear to have influenced the submitted work.\n\n## Author Contributions\n\n**Concept and design:**  Anusuya S.

Email: grahal@me.com Abstract Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) is characterized by a focus on contextual change and advances topics like acceptance, mindfulness, values, spirituality and relationship. It sets itself apart from other third wave approaches by bringing to the center of the therapeutic work values clarification and living. Previous systematic reviews provided support for the efficacy and effectiveness of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) but it’s unknown of reviews that comprehensively assess values interventions with a focus on examining the specific effects of working with values or meaning in life in a wide variety of settings, populations and methodological designs. The goal of this study is to investigate empirical interventions that utilizes values as conceptualized by ACT. Systematic searches in 5 databases were performed up to April 2020. For inclusion, the intervention study must have targeted values process as conceptualized by ACT. Systematic reviews, theoretical or conceptual papers were excluded. Analyzed data were publication year, language, country, number and description of participants, mean age, sample origin, outcome variables, study design and quality and overall results. Seventeen studies were identified. Results show a broad scope of research methods, in a variety of settings and populations. According to reported results, values interventions had the desired effect on the outcome variable.\nKeywords: Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, values, meaning in life, Relational Frame Theory, review.\nHow to cite this paper: Matheus Rahal G & Caserta Gon MC (2020). A Systematic Review of Values Interventions in Acceptance and Commitment Therapy. International Journal of Psychology & Psychological Therapy, 20, 3, 355-372.\nAcceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) is part of the third-wave of behavioral therapies, characterized by a focus on contextual change, an emphasis of function over form and an openness to areas traditionally reserved for the less empirical wings of clinical intervention (Hayes, 2004). It also advances topics like acceptance, mindfulness, cognitive defusion, dialectics, values, spirituality and relationship (Hayes, 2004). ACT sets itself apart from other third-wave approaches by bringing to the center of the therapeutic work values clarification and living (Hayes, Strosahl, & Wilson, 2012).\nNovelty and Significance What is already known about the topic?\n• Previous reviews provide support for the efficacy of ACT across a range of conditions. • Laboratory-based studies indicate that when employing values component of ACT plus mindfulness the effect on outcome variables is large.\nWhat this paper adds?\n• The review found a relevant number of chronic pain studies (35%) and results show that values have a significant effect on targeted variables.\n• Values-based interventions for chronic pain enhance life engagement and pain tolerance.\n• Data collection of the analyzed studies was heavily based on self-report measures. Direct observation of behavior was present in only one study.\n356 © International Journal of Psychology & Psychological Therapy, 2020, 20, 3 https://www. ijpsy. com Matheus Rahal & Caserta Gon Values play a central role in ACT. According to Hayes, Strosahl, and Wilson (2012), “all ACT techniques are eventually subordinated to helping the client live in accord with his or her chosen values” (p. 322). Differently from symptom reduction psychotherapy’s, valued living is the primary treatment outcome of ACT (Wilson, Sandoz, Kitchens, & Roberts, 2010). The goal is to generate the conditions for the client to behave according to personal values while being willing to notice the aversive private events that show up as a consequence of living.\nACT defines values as “freely chosen, verbally constructed consequences of ongoing, dynamic, evolving patterns of activity, which establish predominant reinforcers for that activity that are intrinsic in engagement in the valued behavioral pattern itself” (Wilson & DuFrene, 2009, p. 66). The behavior of valuing is an example of verbal behavior and is understood in ACT through the lens of Relational Frame Theory (RFT). This functional analytic theory of language and cognition seeks to understand and influence language phenomena through the study of derived stimulus relations and arbitrary applicable relational responding (Hayes, Barnes-Holmes, & Roche, 2001).\nValues research can contribute to understand change processes in psychotherapy, not only limited to ACT. For example, Gloster, Klotsche, Ciarrochi, Eifert, Sonntag, Wittchen, and Hoyer (2017) shows that engagement in valued behaviors precedes reductions in suffering. This finding implies that part of the reason a client is suffering in the first place is due to a disconnect with his/her own personal values (Gloster et alia, 2017). Pain induced laboratory studies also point to the importance of values articulation as strengthening the willingness to act in the presence of pain/suffering (Páez, Luciano, Gutiérrez, Valdivia, Ortega, & Rodríguez, 2008; Páez, Luciano, Gutiérrez, Valdivia, Rodríguez, & Ortega, 2008).\nPrevious systematic reviews provided support for the efficacy and effectiveness of ACT across a range of conditions including psychosis (Wakefield, Roebuck, & Boyden, 2018), anxiety disorders (García & Valdivia, 2018; Soo, Tate, & Lane-Brown, 2011; Swain, Hancock, Hainsworth, & Bowman, 2013), body image (Griffiths, Williamson, Zucchelli, Paraskeva, & Moss, 2018), chronic pain (Feliu Soler, Montesinos, Gutiérrez, Scott, McCracken, & Luciano, 2018; Hann & McCracken, 2014; Hughes, Clark, Colclough, Dale, & McMillan, 2017), chronic diseases and long-term conditions (Graham, Gouick, Krahé, & Gillanders, 2016). There are also systematic review that evaluate different methods of delivery, including web-delivery (Brown, Glendenning, Hoon, & John, 2016) and self-help (French, Golijani-Moghaddam, & Schröder, 2017). Meta-analysis of ACT effectiveness and its empirical support look at the results of the complete intervention package (c.f. Feliu Soler et alia, 2018; Ruiz, 2010; Smout, Hayes, Atkins, Klausen, & Duguid, 2012).\nLevin, Hildebrandt, Lillis, and Hayes (2012) evaluated the effect of various ACT model components individually, but limits itself to laboratory-based studies. The results indicate that when comparing values component with inactive control, the impact of the various studies on primary outcome was small (Cohen d= .41, N= 5) but when combined with mindfulness interventions it was large (d= 1.37, N= 5; mindfulness alone d=.46, N= 8). An example of values only laboratory intervention was writing about personally relevant values. For values plus mindful, interventions included metaphors like “Tug-of-war with a monster” and “Chinese finger trap” (cf. Stoddard & Afari, 2014). Imagery exercises linked endurance of pain for the purpose of previously identified personal value. In overall, values plus mindful interventions created a value-oriented context that encouraged the participants to continue with the task despite the exposure to pain or discomfort.\nhttps://www. ijpsy. com © International Journal of Psychology & Psychological Therapy, 2020, 20, 3 Values Interventions in ACT 357 Another study worth mentioning is Stockton, Kellett, Berrios, Sirois, Wilkinson, & Miles (2019), a systematic review of the mediational impact of ACT components. Only one study that examined values as a mediational process was referred to. To this date is unknown of reviews that comprehensively assess values interventions with a focus on examining the specific effects of working with values or meaning in life in a wide variety of settings, populations and methodological designs.\nThe goal of this work is to analyze empirical intervention studies that investigate the effects of ACT values component. To achieve this end, it was carried out a systematic review of interventions that used values component of ACT. Method This review was based on Manchado Garabito, Tamames Gómez, López González, Mohedano Macías, D’Agostino, & Veiga de Cabo (2009) exploratory systematic review protocol, that aims to explore a certain field by reviewing multiple studies and interventions types. The protocol is composed of the following steps: 1) definition of inclusion and exclusion criteria, 2) identification of data sources and search strategies, 3) selection and classification of studies, 4) choice of variables to be assessed, 5) data analysis.\nFor inclusion in this study the articles needed to be published in a peer-reviewed journal in Portuguese or English. Unpublished dissertations or thesis were excluded. For inclusion, the study must have targeted values process as conceptualized by ACT, and if other processes were also targeted, i.e. the intervention delivered all ACT components, results must show the moderating/mediational effect of values alone in the overall treatment result. Systematic reviews, theoretical or conceptual papers were excluded.\nA systematic search for articles on values interventions was conducted up to April 2020 on 5 electronic databases (IndexPSI, PePSIC, PsycINFO, Scielo and WebOfScience). For Portuguese databases, the search terms applied were any (“terapia de aceitação e compromisso”) AND title (“valores”, “sentido”, “propósito”). A search in English was conducted in all databases using search terms any (“acceptance and commitment therapy” OR “acceptance-based behavioral therapy”) AND title (“valu*”, “meaning”, “purpose”). No date restrictions were applied. Acceptance-based Behavioral Therapy developed by Roemer & Orsillo (2014) became part of the search after showing up in the initial screening. This approach also uses values as conceptualized by ACT.\nThe selection of studies occurred according to the defined inclusion and exclusion criteria. After removal of duplicates and screening abstracts of the remaining studies, full-text articles were retrieved for examination.\nThe extracted data of included studies were publication year, language, country, number and description of participants, mean age, percent female, sample origin (e.g. clinical vs. non-clinical sample), outcome variables (e.g. measure of psychological symptoms), study design (e.g. mediational analysis, laboratory-based), quality (e.g. randomized, controlled, follow-up) and overall results.\nThe data was organized in Mendeley, taking advantage of its ta"

Without cold, there is no ice cream… and without Self, there is no healing in IFS. I am going to answer a few questions about Self and Self-energy.\n\n## What is the difference between Self and Self-energy?\n\nSelf is a state of consciousness from which is possible to heal mental health issues. When we are in “Self”, we experience (some of) the so-called 8 C’s, which are *Compassion, Curiosity, Calm, Clarity, Courage, Connectedness, Confidence, and Creativity*. There are 5 further attributes to Self, which are knows as the 5 P’s, and they are *Playfulness, Patience, Presence, Perspective, and Persistence*.\n\nReaders who have good memory might find it easy to remember all these words, but it is not necessary to be able to list them or learn them by heart. For example, if you are on the dyslexic spectrum like me, you might want to rely on the **experience of being in Self** without using words. I call this the “embodied experience of Self”.\n\n### The embodied experience of Self\n\nI use the word “embodied” because Self is not just an idea, but it is a state of being that includes a state of mind, feelings and body. When you are in Self, you can experience the following in your body\n\nA sense of expansion in your chest area\n\nThe body feels lighter\n\nThe head feels less crowded and thinking is more clear and peaceful\n\nBreathing is smooth and deeper than usual\n\nFace muscles are relaxed\n\nAt times, if there is a lot of stress in the system, feelings of tiredness are felt when in Self.\n\nIt is now time to describe what is Self-energy. Self-energy is basically the experience that goes with the state of Self. “Energy” is a much wider word than “experience” and describes what it feels to be in Self, the “vibe” that a person feels and radiates when a person is in Self. IFS therapists constantly encourage the expansion of Self-energy and try to understand how much Self-energy is available to the client at any given moment of therapy.\n\nThe ides of Self-energy is more flexible than Self because some parts of the system can hold various degrees of Self-energy even if these parts are not Self. We can describe the process of healing through IFS as the process of allowing all parts to operate with as much Self-energy as possible.\n\n## Why is Self so important in IFS?\n\nSelf is key to IFS Therapy because it is at the base of its healing principle and it is also important experience clients have during an effective IFS session.\n\nThe healing principle of IFS Therapy is the following:\n\nHealing happens when Self interacts with parts. The stronger the relationship between Self and parts is, the more healing will spontaneously happen\n\nThe aim of each IFS Therapy session is for the client to identify parts, enter the state of Self, and, from that state, communicate to the parts.\n\nThe more empathic, compassionate, open and calm the communication between Self and parts is, the more healing happens. It is through this dialogue that parts heal from traumas, let go of dysfunctional behaviours and of distorted views of reality.\n\n## 3 ways to describe Self in IFS\n\nSelf can be described in various ways. The reader is free to choose whatever way suits best their belief system. I am going to present here three definitions, which, I believe, are all valid.\n\n**1) the traditional way**\n\nIFS books describe Self as the “absence of parts”. In other words, by asking parts to step aside, people automatically experience the state that we call Self. In this state, people experience calm, clarity of thought, courage and compassion.\n\n**2) the spiritual way**\n\nThe traditional definition of Self seems very close to the idea of “Higher Self” or of “Spirit” or “Inner wisdom” that is in common in various spiritual traditions. It is a state of consciousness characterised by love, calm and compassion.\n\n**3) The “undamaged” part of yourself**\n\nThis is one of my favourite because it instantly gives me hope and reminds me that, whatever difficulty or problem one person might be facing, there is more to life. We are more than our anxieties and mental health problems, and there is a part of us that is not damaged and that has not been touched by trauma. This undamaged Self not only exists, but it always available to create healing.\n\n## Remember that “*We are more than our parts*”\n\nSo… who are we? I like to think that we are the result of the interaction of Self and of our parts. When we are too separate from Self and our parts do not have much Self-energy available, we over-identify with parts and with the pain, traumas and distorted views of reality that these parts might carry.\n\nThe most important (and at times difficult) task to improve our mental health is to remember that there is always more to us and our lives than the pains and problems we are experiencing in that moment of life.\n\nIt is, unfortunately, difficult to experience Self without the assistance of an IFS trained therapist. Even if we can all experience Self, it takes time and guidance to access it consciously.\n\nAt times, if the internal system of a person is particularly burdened and heavily protected, it can take more than one IFS Sessions to experience a sense of Self, from which healing can happen.\n\n**One final note…**\n\nI hope this article has given you some insight into the IFS method.

IFS Therapy helps clients form a deeply satisfying relationship with themselves and others, unburdening their trauma and accessing their self-energy (Herbine-Blank, n.d.). Therapy using the IFS model addresses and communicates with these parts, attempting to help the client find balance and harmony within their mind and elevate their self to the system’s leadership.

They are clustered into the following three groups (Sweezy & Ziskind, 2013; IFS Institute, n.d.):\n\n* *Managers*  \n   Managers are a protective group of parts that attempt to keep us organized and safe, running our day-to-day lives. Over time, they may push for [perfectionism](https://positivepsychology.com/how-to-overcome-perfectionism/) and even inflict harm in their pursuit of safety.\n* *Exiles*  \n   Exiles are the injured parts of us and have typically experienced trauma. Exiled by the managers, they can become increasingly extreme, ultimately overriding the managers to become who we are.\n* *Firefighters*  \n   Firefighters are another form of protection that “put out the emotional fire at any cost,” often starting backfires. They do so in several ways, including unhealthy or unhelpful behavior, such as alcohol and drug abuse and eating disorders (Sweezy & Ziskind, 2013, p. xviii).\n\nOther theories relying on the single or *mono-mind* model may lead us to fear or dislike ourselves, believing “we only have one mind (full of primitive or sinful aspects) that we can’t control” (Schwartz, 2021, p. 12). Therapies based on this model often require clients to “correct irrational beliefs or meditate them away” (Schwartz, 2021, p. 12).\n\nOn the other hand, Schwartz’s IFS model argues that the ego comprises multiple *parts* trying to keep us safe. IFS Therapy finds ways to help our ego relax, allowing those parts of our personality we have buried (exiles) to ascend, freeing memories, emotions, and beliefs associated with them (burdens) that were previously locked away (Schwartz, 2021).\n\nWith this in mind, Schwartz’s (2021, p. 32) IFS Therapy has four goals:\n\n1. To liberate parts from the roles they have been forced into, freeing them to be who they were designed to be.\n2. To restore faith in the self and in [self-leadership](https://positivepsychology.com/self-leadership/).\n3. To re-harmonize the inner system.\n4. To encourage the client to become increasingly self led in their interactions with the world.\n\nWhile IFS Therapy is a powerful approach for helping *individuals*, it can be equally successful with *couples*. According to Herbine-Blank (n.d.), “once the individuals in a couple have more access to Self, transformation is natural,” and they can find the space and capacity to choose a response rather than simply react to it, even if the other cannot at the time.\n\nEach partner is encouraged to bring compassion to their wounded inner parts and heal their past, gaining control over their present (Herbine-Blank, n.d.).\n\n## 6 Internal Family Systems Therapy Worksheets\n\nIFS Therapy helps clients form a deeply satisfying relationship with themselves and others, unburdening their trauma and accessing their self-energy (Herbine-Blank, n.d.).\n\nWhile there are many aspects to IFS as a theory and treatment model, the primary healing relationship “is between the client’s Self and her young, injured parts” (Sweezy & Ziskind, 2013, p. 1).\n\nThe notion of *parts* is crucial to the IFS model. Therapy using the IFS model addresses and communicates with these parts, attempting to help the client find balance and harmony within their mind and elevate their self to the system’s leadership. To those unfamiliar with IFS Therapy, the language and conversation style may seem unusual, involving talking directly to the different parts of the self (IFS Institute, n.d.).\n\nThe following worksheets offer a range of tools for facilitating various aspects of this powerful and complex treatment to engage with and better understand the many parts of the self (modified from Anderson, Sweezy, & Schwartz, 2017; Sweezy & Ziskind, 2013; Schwartz, 2021):\n\n### All Parts Are Welcome\n\nThe [All Parts Are Welcome](https://positive.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/All-Parts-Are-Welcome.pdf) exercise was created by Schwartz and his team to help the client welcome all parts of their self, using their attention and a few simple questions (Anderson et al., 2017).\n\n### The Six Fs\n\nA key aspect of IFS Therapy is to *“find, focus* on and *flesh* out” the client’s protective parts and help them “unblend and notice the client’s Self” (Anderson et al., 2017, p. 93). Next, the client can recognize their *feelings* toward and *befriend* the target part, explore its *fears*, and invite it to do something new.\n\nExperienced practitioners can use the [Six Fs Internal Family Systems](https://positive.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/6Fs-Internal-Family-System.pdf) worksheet to successfully differentiate the protective parts from the self and form vital alliances.\n\n## World’s Largest Positive Psychology Resource\n\n*The Positive Psychology Toolkit©* is a groundbreaking practitioner resource containing over 500 science-based exercises, activities, interventions, questionnaires, and assessments created by experts using the latest positive psychology research.\n\nUpdated monthly. 100% science-based.\n\n*“The best positive psychology resource out there!”*   \n — Emiliya Zhivotovskaya, Flourishing Center CEO\n\n[Get Instant Access](https://pro.positivepsychology.com/sale-page/positive-psychology-toolkit/)\n\n### Understanding Our Relationship With a *Part*\n\nAfter identifying a part of the self, clients can explore it in greater detail to better understand whether it is doing its job.\n\nUse the [Understanding Our Relationship With a *Part*](https://positive.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Understanding-Our-Relationship-With-a-Part.pdf) worksheet to identify the role and intent of the part under scrutiny by asking a series of questions:\n\n1. What is its role, and how does it help you manage your life?\n2. What is its relationship with other people?\n3. What positive intent does it have for you?\n4. How does it try to protect you?\n5. What is it trying to protect you from?\n6. Is it happy with its job? Or would it prefer something else?\n\nAs clients focus and make notes during the exercise, they may find that their relationship toward the part changes.\n\n### Identifying Parts of Yourself Through Drawing\n\nIt is not easy to recognize all the parts of the self. Drawing or doodling can provide a more intuitive, less concrete way to capture, describe, and show the connections between each part.\n\nIn the [Identifying Parts of Yourself Through Drawing](https://positive.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Identifying-Parts-of-Yourself-Through-Drawing.pdf) worksheet, clients can create a picture to capture the various parts of the self and how they combine.\n\nDrawing the picture and working through this exercise can help them form a clearer understanding of the parts and their relationship to the self.\n\n### Identifying Managers and Firefighters\n\nWhile *managers* help us plan and shape our lives and avoid discomfort and pain, *firefighters* rush in and try to fix the problem. We may recognize both in how we cope. For example, when life is calm, we may plan; when we’re hectic or stressed, we may eat or drink too much.\n\nThe [Identifying Managers and Firefighters Using IFS Therapy](https://positive.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Identifying-Managers-and-Firefighters-using-IFS-Therapy.pdf) worksheet helps identify manager and firefighter parts using the senses and asking a series of questions, including:\n\n* What bodily sensations accompany the part?\n* How do you feel regarding each part?\n* How does each part feel about you?\n\nIt should be clear from the answers whether the part is a manager or a firefighter.\n\n### What the Self Is and Isn’t in IFS Therapy\n\nHaving used IFS Therapy with many clients to explore their self, Schwartz (2021) identified eight Cs engaged in self-energy and self-leadership shared by almost everyone.\n\nThe [What the Self Is and Isn’t in IFS Therapy](https://positive.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/What-the-Self-Is-and-Isnt-in-IFS-Therapy.pdf) worksheet explores the eight Cs, encourages the client to notice the quality in themselves, and asks what each means to them:\n\n* *Curiosity*\n* *Calm*\n* *Confidence*\n* *Compassion*\n* *Creativity*\n* *Clarity*\n* *Courage*\n* *Connectedness*\n\nConsidering each one will make you feel more connected to humanity. And “when people sense how connected they are to humanity, they feel more curious about others and have more courage to help them” (Schwartz, 2021, p. 93).\n\nDr. Richard Schwartz explains Internal Family Systems (IFS)\n\n## Top 2 IFS Exercises for Your Sessions\n\nRichard Schwartz’s (2021) latest book, *No Bad Parts*, is an accessible read for those interested in his IFS approach to therapy, clarifying the nature of parts and the techniques to uncover them. According to Schwartz (2021. p. 17), “each part is like a person with a true purpose” that can be uncovered.\n\nThe following exercises are two of the most powerful techniques in this fascinating and powerful model (simplified from Schwartz, 2021):\n\n### The path of self\n\nThis exercise uses visualization to explore self and self-energy, using the metaphor of a journey.\n\nAsk the client to perform the following steps:\n\n* Find a comfortable position and begin by taking slow, deep breaths.\n* Imagine yourself meeting your parts at the beginning of a path.\n* Ask the parts to wait there as you head off on a journey.\n* Notice how they react. Are they afraid? Some days, they may not want you to go. And that’s okay. You can wait for another day to continue.\n* If it’s okay to proceed, head out on your imagined journey.\n* As you progress, if you find you are still *thinking* or *watching yourself*, then some parts are likely to have remained with you. See if they are willing to stay behind. Repeat as many times as required.\n* As you remove parts*,* feel yourself becoming lighter, moving toward pure awareness without thought.\n* You should begin to experience, among other things, clarity, a sense of wellbeing, and confidence.\n* Invite the energy you are feeling into your body.\n* Pause and experience what it is like to have so much *self* in your body.\n* When you’re ready, take some deep breaths and return your focus to the room.\n\nRepeat this exercise regularly, trying to remember how it feels throughout your day.\n\n## Download 5 Free Positive Psychology Tools\n\nStart thriving today with 5 free tools grounded in the science of positive psychology.\n\nDownload Tools\n\n### Fire drill\n\nThe following reflective exercise is a valuable way to revisit parts in life and learn self-leadership through practice and experience.\n\nAsk the client to perform the following steps:\n\n* Picture someone in your life (past or present) who triggers anger or sadness in you.\n* Imagine them in a room from which they cannot leave.\n* Watch the person from outside the room through a one-way mirror. You can see them, but they cannot see you.\n* Now have them do or say the things that upset you.\n* Notice what happens to your body and mind as your *protector* part kicks in (your muscles, heart rate, breathing, thoughts, and emotions).\n* Now look at the person through the eyes of your protector. Reassure your protector that you will not be entering that room.\n* Encourage the protector to recognize that you are not at risk, so it can stand down.\n* See if your protector is prepared to separate its energy from you. Encourage it to take the energy away.\n* Now recheck yourself.

Developed by Dr. Richard Schwartz, it aims to achieve internal harmony by understanding and integrating these parts.\n\nWhat are the main types of parts in IFS therapy?\n\nIn IFS, parts are categorized into Managers, Exiles, and Firefighters. Managers protect by controlling daily life, Exiles carry past traumas, and Firefighters react impulsively to distract from pain.\n\nWhat are the benefits of IFS therapy?\n\nIFS therapy can reduce symptoms of anxiety and depression, enhance self-compassion, and improve emotional wellbeing by promoting internal harmony and self-leadership.\n\nReferences\n\n* Anderson, F., Sweezy, M., & Schwartz, R.

I was in IFS therapy . Eventually the therapist referred me to another as he chose to train more people. Covid hit, and this therapist didn’t get past the first level in training. She is using DBR with me, which helps, but I believe this therapy is the best to use ongoing, as life continues on. I have noticed different parts of myself since I was a child and am relieved that it is a fact. My hope is to someday train and help others as well.\n\n   [Reply](#comment-193079)\n\n   * Julia Poernbacher, M.Sc.  on May 18, 2025 at 22:38\n\n     Hi Fran,\n\n     Thank you for sharing; it’s wonderful to hear how IFS has helped you make sense of your experience.

Reading about the triggering person and letting go of your protection and walking in the room to be with that very person who is powerful and makes you small seems an awful lot like forgiveness in a new way.

The book \\*No Bad Parts\\* is a good introduction to the theory and how to put it together.\n\n     But a personal example is, I have a manager part my therapist and I call Miss Piggy. Direct, if overdramatic. But when she gets too overbearing, a part we call “surfer man” comes in, and I start to dissociate rather than keep engaging with what Miss Piggy is saying. He’s a protector. So we’re working on letting surfer man help me calm down and stay engaged with the thoughts Miss Piggy is bringing forward.\n\n     The self in this model is the part of me that has the ability to observe my other parts and not directly identify with those thoughts. Like if you’ve ever had a really random thought and immediately gone, “where did that come from?” The self is the part saying “where did that come from?” with curiosity.\n\n     [Reply](#comment-188238)\n\n     + Bruce E Thomas  on May 13, 2025 at 20:51\n\n       Does fabricating stories about internal imaginary personalities actually work as a therapy technique?

Why not try some of those out first to see if it is what you want/need? (I clicked on the download links — they email them to you). For me personally, it’s been very beneficial because I grew up in a controlling household where my family wanted to make decisions. So in therapy the therapist demanding he reparent me was not good. IFS fixes that by giving you the power to reparent youself.\n\n     [Reply](#comment-35011)\n7.

They are part of me. Most of the time I like them better than I like Me. Often the easiest way out of a situation is to blend with the right part.

The first time I heard it (in a level 1 training) my eyes shot open and I didn’t go any farther. When Dick leads this exercise he’s very careful to say “If it feels right to your system” several times, and he gives the option to just stay with the parts if that feels better. My system likes this better.\n\n     [Reply](#comment-27421)\n\n     + Tammi  on September 20, 2022 at 19:26\n\n       Thank you for this comment!\n\n       [Reply](#comment-28111)\n     + Niklaes  on July 13, 2023 at 08:51\n\n       I think it’s helpful to know that there are no parts that are supposed to be left behind. I believe that would be impossible, and trying so would go against how we are composed. As the Richard Schwartz 2021 book says in the title “No Bad Parts”. The goal is to let go of the burdens of the exiles so that the ego/protector parts can fall back and into their natural roles where they are active or activated when needed. Opposed to being in an extreme role 24/7. The latter being taxing on our body. A couple of years ago I was working with a client who was letting go of a lot of grief. Then one day the client was exposed to manipulation by a partner where the client immediately reacted firmly without inner conflict. The client surprised asked her-/himself “where the heck did that come from?”. I think this is a good example of a manager-protector previously being occupied by protecting an exile to becoming free to stand up for the client. Previously this would not be possible, because leaving the position of protecting the exile to stand up for the client would have left the exiled part exposed. The exiled part now unburdened made the manager part free to do what it is supposed to do. Which is natural preservation of the person when needed.\n\n       When children, and grownups, are doing well and at peace they are anchored in their whole body and self with the ability to just observe with no thoughts at all, but all parts are present. At this moment here is no need for achievement, management, or protection, so no part is activated.\n\n       [Reply](#comment-34543)\n\n       - Charlotte  on October 2, 2023 at 13:59\n\n         Yes this exactly.

At the core of IFS lies the belief that each individual possesses a wise center, often referred to as the Self.\n\nThe Self in IFS is defined by the “8 C’s” and “5 P’s”. The 8 C’s are Curiosity, Compassion, Calm, Clarity, Courage, Confidence, Creativity, and Connectedness. The 5 P’s are Presence, Perspective, Patience, Persistence, and Playfulness. Let’s take a look at what these mean and how they can help us understand ourselves better.\n\n**The 8 C’s of the Self in IFS Therapy:**\n\n**Curiosity:** This means being open-minded and wanting to understand things instead of judging them.\n\n**Compassion:** It’s all about being kind and understanding, especially to our own feelings of hurt or sadness.\n\n**Calm:** This is about feeling centered and peaceful inside, even when things are tough.\n\n**Clarity:** It’s like having a clear picture of what we want and who we are, which helps us know where we’re going.\n\n**Courage:** This means being brave enough to face our fears and explore our feelings.\n\n**Confidence:** It’s believing in ourselves and knowing we’re worth it, even when we feel unsure.\n\n**Creativity:** The Self is full of new ideas and ways to express ourselves.\n\n## Get Morgan Levine, LCSW’s stories in your inbox\n\nJoin Medium for free to get updates from this writer.\n\n**Connectedness:** Feeling connected to ourselves, others, and the world around us.\n\n**The 5 P’s in IFS Therapy:**\n\n**Presence:** Being present and aware of what’s happening inside us without getting overwhelmed.\n\n**Perspective:** Seeing things from a bigger view, beyond just how we feel right now.\n\n**Patience:** Being okay with taking things slow and not rushing our healing journey.\n\n**Persistence:** Keep going, even when things get tough, because we know it’s worth it.\n\n**Playfulness:** Approaching life with a light-hearted attitude and finding joy in exploring ourselves.\n\nIn IFS therapy, these qualities help us understand and heal ourselves. By practicing the 8 C’s and 5 P’s, we can discover who we really are and feel better inside.To start using these qualities in your own life, try noticing moments when you feel curious, compassionate, present, courageous, etc. Then, try bringing that same energy to your thoughts and feelings. It’s a personal journey, and it’s okay if it takes time.\n\nIf you want help along the way, talking to an IFS-informed therapist can be really helpful. Exploring these qualities can lead us to a deeper understanding of ourselves and a more authentic way of living.\n\n**Authorship:** This blog was written by [Morgan Levine, LCSW](https://ifsemdrtherapy.com/morgan-levine).

It is based on the book [Self Therapy](https://www.amazon.com/Self-Therapy-Step-Step-Cutting-Edge-Psychotherapy/dp/0578395940?crid=1I2ZSXRCAK0R1&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.s0gtJUIFwTly_6oieGdgx-3QEbxojAZtmRIS4-umr8BSawm8KSSx4_d0RaS_2tWY7DPGrwJWrKFJn2bWPdAJstPfsWG8Gn9QKQF-s1FzrK8gQrUGzPnIcAETOu2QNLmK_LQS6UjgPumgd3w_5-DQ5djCk_0z5TpSncIdZ1NJlL5sfApXN3rwsdjE4cq1hVJSGyLdOYBqR8ZHkVAEkiPlRIM0oaxkjtSwatD3B0abLsU.FyTzIdM9fJQFCxixMkX_tg3BCVJC2xdDwAXFSI-OB7s&dib_tag=se&keywords=self+therapy+jay+earley&qid=1722019969&sprefix=Self+Therapy%2Caps%2C232&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=2potatoes-20&linkId=9c75636d2a9b2f696e976bb371d47eae&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl) by Jay Early (affiliate link.)\n\nI keep these steps and sample questions on a piece of paper next to me, and it helps keep me from getting “lost” while doing the work.\n\n(A list of the other articles I’ve written about my IFS journey is available in my article [My Internal Family Systems Experience](/@braintots/my-internal-family-systems-experience-20aac247e626).)\n\n## 1. Get to know a Protector\n\n## P1. Accessing a Protector\n\nFind a part that you’d like to work with. You might:\n\n* Ask and see if there are any parts that would like to do the work now.\n* Access a trailhead. If there aren’t any parts volunteering to do the work, think of a recent situation where a part was activated, and recall the situation.\n\n## P2. Unblend from the Target Protector\n\nSeparate yourself from the part, exploring it as a separate entity within you. You might:\n\n* Ask the part to separate from you, so you can get to know it,\n* Move back, internally, to separate yourself from the part,\n* See an image of the part at a distance.\n\n## P3. Unblend from any Concerned Parts\n\nSeparate yourself from any parts that are concerned with the target part. This might be a part that is arguing with the target part, or blocking it from being seen. Start by:\n\n* Checking to see how you feel about the target part. If it is anything other than “compassionate and curious” (“Self”), try to separate from the concerned part.\n* Ask the concerned part if it would be willing to step aside for a bit.\n* Ask the concerned part what it is afraid of if it were to step aside.\n* If it won’t step aside, after a bit of explanation, ask it if it is willing to become the target part.\n\nRepeat the steps above with all concerned parts, until you are feeling compassionate and curious about the target part.\n\n## P4. Discover the Protector’s Role\n\nGet to know the protector. Ask it questions like:\n\n* What do you feel? (I like to touch the areas of my body where I am feeling sensations/tension.)\n* What are you concerned about?\n* What is your role? What do you do to perform this role?\n* What do you hope to accomplish by playing this role?\n* What are you afraid would happen if you didn’t perform this role?\n\n## P5. Build Trust with the Protector\n\nExpress your curiosity and compassion to the protector. If they are true, you might consider the following:\n\n* “I understand why you are performing this role / doing what you do.”\n* “I appreciate your efforts on my behalf.”\n* “I know you’ve been working very hard.”\n\nIf you are not feeling these things, explore step **P3** again, and proceed from there.\n\n## 2. Obtain Permission to work with the Exile\n\nThe protector has likely been guarding an exile. It’s time to ask the protector and the exile if you can work with the exile.\n\n* Ask the Protector to show you the Exile.\n* Ask the Protector for permission to get to know the exile.\n\nIf the Protector is unwilling:\n\n* Ask the Protector what it is afraid would happen if you talk to the Exile.\n* Reassure it that you can stay in Self and not be overwhelmed by the pain.\n* Reassure it that you are trying to heal the pain.\n* Reassure it that the Protector can take over again if it becomes uncomfortable. (I invite my Protectors to stand by and watch the whole process.)\n* Reassure the Protector that it can take on whatever role it wants within your system when the pain is healed.\n\nSometimes the answer will be “no”, and that’s okay. Let your Protector and Exile know that you understand they are not ready. “Self” will be here when they are ready. Ask for permission to confer with them another time and, when you do, start from the beginning again.\n\n## 3. Get to know the exile\n\n## E1. Access the Exile\n\nSense the Exile in your body, or get an image of the Exile.\n\n## E2. Unblend from the Exile\n\nAsk the Exile to step back from control so that you can get to know it. You might:\n\n* Ask the Exile to contain its feelings, so you can be there for it.\n* Consciously separate form the exile and return to Self.\n* Get an image of the exile at a distance from you.\n\nIf the exile won’t contain its feelings:\n\n* Ask it what it is afraid would happen if it relinquished control for a while.\n* Explain that you really want to witness its feelings and story, but you need to separate from it in order to do that.\n\n## E3. Unblend from Concerned Parts\n\nCheck how you feel towards the Exile. If it is not compassionate and curious, follow the same steps as outlined in P3 until you are able to find your compassion for the Exile.\n\n## E4. Get to know the Exile\n\nAsk it:\n\n* What do you feel?\n* What makes you feel so scared/hurt/whatever feelings it is feeling?\n\n## E5. Develop a trusting relationship\n\n* Listen to the Exile and hear its story\n* Communicate compassion and caring.\n* Check to see that the Exile can sense you there.\n* Notice if the Exile is feeling your compassion.\n\n## 4. Access and Witness the Exile’s childhood origins\n\n* Ask the Exile to show you an image or memory of when it learned to feel the way it feels.\n* Ask the Exile how it has made you feel.\n* Verify that the Exile has shown you everything it wanted you to witness.\n* Verify that the Exile believes that you understand how bad it was.\n\n## 5. Reparent the Exile\n\nBring “Self” to the childhood situation and ask the Exile what it needs from you to heal it or change what happened. It might be something like:\n\n* “rewriting” the story, or\n* comforting the Exile, or\n* standing up for the Exile\n\nGive the Exile what it needs in order to feel loved and cared for.\n\n## 6. Retrieve the Exile (Optional)\n\nIf the Exile is interested, offer to take it someplace else — a place of safety in your present life, or your body, or an imaginary place.\n\n(Note that I often do this step before Step 5.)\n\n## 7. Unburden the Exile\n\n* Name the burdens (extreme feelings or beliefs) that the Exile is carrying.\n* Ask the Exile if it wants to give up or release the burdens, and if it’s ready to do so.\n* If not, ask the Exile what it is afraid would happen if it let go ov them? Address any fears that might come up.\n* Ask the Exile how it carries the burdens in or on its body.\n* Ask the Exile how it would like to release its burdens. Recommendations tend to be to the core elements: light, water, wind and fire.\n* When the burdens are gone, notice the positive qualities of the Exile.\n\n## 8. Integrate and Unburden the Protector\n\nRevisit the protector from Step 1.\n\n* Introduce it to the transformed Exile.\n* Ask the Protector if it believes that its role of protection is still necessary.\n* If not, repeat Step 7 with the Protector as the target of the unburdening.\n* Invite the Protector to choose a new role within your system.\n\nFinally, imagine yourself in the original trailhead and see if any parts become activated. Work your way through all these steps for any additional parts that become activated.\n\n## Notes from my practice\n\n* I feel free to stop at any time along the path. Sometimes an Exile or a Protector just isn’t in the mood to do this work, and that’s okay. I’ll invite it to reach out when it’s ready to do the work, ask it for permission to check in again later, and go about the rest of my day.\n* I have 3 locations that most of my parts are retrieved to: the “Control Room”, the “Garden”, and the “Gazebo.” In each of these locations they can be with other parts.\n* Lately, most of my unburdenings end with the Parts releasing their burdens into the ground, which creates flower patches in the garden. It’s pretty nice.\n* Towards the beginning, most of my unburdenings ended with Fire or Lightning. The Fire was released into the Furnace (a Part) which is in the Control Room, and a personification of the energy that anger brings. (Lightning seems to be correlated for me with the type energy that nervousness brings.)\n* It can easily take me an hour to get through Step 1. It almost always takes me more than an hour-and-a-half to get through all of the steps.\n* I perform the unblending steps — P2, P3, E2 and E3 — pretty informally. Usually just the check “do I feel compassion for the target Part?”\n* But I am vigilant during the other steps to see if I’ve blended with a part. If I find that there’s an argument going on in my head (or unkindness, or anything other than curiosity), I’ll revisit the P3 and E3 steps, and then continue on.\n\n[Internal Family System](/tag/internal-family-system?source=post_page-----7dada3fb0e18---------------------------------------)\n\n[Self Therapy](/tag/self-therapy?source=post_page-----7dada3fb0e18---------------------------------------)\n\n[Parts Work](/tag/parts-work?source=post_page-----7dada3fb0e18---------------------------------------)\n\n[## Written by braintots](/@braintots?source=post_page---post_author_info--7dada3fb0e18---------------------------------------)\n\n[9 followers](/@braintots/followers?source=post_page---post_author_info--7dada3fb0e18---------------------------------------)\n\n·[1 following](/@braintots/following?source=post_page---post_author_info--7dada3fb0e18---------------------------------------)\n\nSteps to remember for dealing with... stuff\n\n## No responses yet\n\n[Text to speech](https://speechify.com/medium?source=post_page-----7dada3fb0e18---------------------------------------)\n\nTitle: The Internal Family Systems Model Outline | IFS Institute\nURL: https://ifs-institute.com/resources/articles/internal-family-systems-model-outline\nContent: PARTS** * All parts want something positive for the individual and will use a variety of strategies to gain influence within the internal system. 2.

BASIC ASSUMPTIONS OF THE IFS MODEL**\n\n* It is the nature of the mind to be subdivided into an indeterminate number of subpersonalities or parts.\n* Everyone has a Self, and the Self can and should lead the individual's internal system.\n* The non-extreme intention of each part is something positive for the individual. There are no \"bad\" parts, and the goal of therapy is not to eliminate parts but instead to help them find their non-extreme roles.\n* As we develop, our parts develop and form a complex system of interactions among themselves; therefore, systems theory can be applied to the internal system. When the system is reorganized, parts can change rapidly.\n* Changes in the internal system will affect changes in the external system and vice versa. The implication of this assumption is that both the internal and external levels of system should be assessed.\n\n**II. OVERALL GOALS OF THERAPY**\n\n* To achieve balance and harmony within the internal system\n* To differentiate and elevate the Self so it can be an effective leader in the system\n* When the Self is in the lead, the parts will provide input to the Self but will respect the leadership and ultimate decision making of the Self.\n* All parts will exist and lend talents that reflect their non-extreme intentions.\n\n**III. PARTS**\n\n* Subpersonalities are aspects of our personality that interact internally in sequences and styles that are similar to the ways in which people interact.\n* Parts may be experienced in any number of ways -- thoughts, feelings, sensations, images, and more.\n* All parts want something positive for the individual and will use a variety of strategies to gain influence within the internal system.\n* Parts develop a complex system of interactions among themselves. Polarizations develop as parts try to gain influence within the system.\n* While experiences affect parts, parts are not created by the experiences. They are always in existence, either as potential or actuality.\n* Parts that become extreme are carrying \"burdens\" -- energies that are not inherent in the function of the part and don't belong to the nature of the part, such as extreme beliefs, emotions, or fantasies. Parts can be helped to \"unburden\" and return to their natural balance.\n* Parts that have lost trust in the leadership of the Self will \"blend\" with or take over the Self.\n\n**IV. SELF**\n\n* Different level of entity than the parts -- often in the center of the \"you\" that the parts are talking to or that likes or dislikes, listens to, or shuts out various parts\n* When differentiated, the Self is competent, secure, self-assured, relaxed, and able to listen and respond to feedback.\n* The Self can and should lead the internal system.\n* Various levels of experience of the Self:\n  1. When completely differentiated from all parts (Self alone), people describe a feeling of being \"centered.\"\n  2. When the individual is \"in Self\" or when the Self is in the lead while interacting with others (day-to-day experience), the Self is experienced along with the non-extreme aspects of the parts.\n* An empowering aspect of the model is that everyone has a Self.\n\n**V. GENERAL GROUPS OF PARTS**\n\n* EXILES\n  1. Young parts that have experienced trauma and often become isolated from the rest of the system in an effort to protect the individual from feeling the pain, terror, fear, and so on, of these parts\n  2. If exiled, can become increasingly extreme and desperate in an effort to be cared for and tell their story\n  3. Can leave the individual feeling fragile and vulnerable\n* MANAGERS\n  1. Parts that run the day-to-day life of the individual\n  2. Attempt to keep the individual in control of every situation and relationship in an effort to protect parts from feeling any hurt or rejection\n  3. Can do this in any number of ways or through a combination of parts -- striving, controlling, evaluating, caretaking, terrorizing, and so on.\n* FIREFIGHTERS\n  1. Group of parts that react when exiles are activated in an effort to control and extinguish their feelings\n  2. Can do this in any number of ways, including drug or alcohol use, self-mutilation (cutting), binge-eating, sex binges\n  3. Have the same goals as managers (to keep exiles away) but different strategies\n\n**VI. BEGINNING TO USE THE MODEL**\n\n* Assess client's parts and sequences around the problem.\n* Look for polarizations:\n  1. Within individuals\n  2. Among family members\n* Look for parallel dynamics: The way you relate to your own parts parallels the way you relate to those parts of others.\n* Introduce the language of the model.\n* Check for individual's awareness of parts -- ask how he or she experiences the part: thoughts, feelings, sensations, images, and so on.\n* When working with families, check for the family's awareness of parts in self and others.\n* Make a decision about how to begin using the model: language, direct access, imagery, and so on.\n* Come to agreement with client on initial goals of therapy in terms of the internal system -- create a \"contract.\"\n* Assess the fears of manager parts and value the roles of the managers; explain how the therapy can work without the feared outcomes of the managers happening.\n* Inventory dangerous firefighters; work with managers' fears about triggering firefighters.\n* Assess client's external context and constraints to doing this work.\n\n**VII. RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL SYSTEMS**\n\n* The way you relate to your own parts parallels the way you relate to those parts of others.\n* Individual's internal system affects and is affected by the external system of which he or she is a part.\n* Internal and external systems often parallel each other.\n\n**VIII. WORKING WITH INDIVIDUALS**\n\n* Protective Parts\n  1. Important to assess protective parts and work with them first.\n  2. Develop a direct relationship with the part.\n  3. May need to negotiate pace of work -- give the part an opportunity to talk about concerns.\n  4. Work out a system for the part to let you know when things are moving too fast.\n  5. Respect the concerns of the part.\n* Non-imaging techniques\n  1. Assessing internal dialogue\n  2. Using the IFS language\n  3. Location/sense of a part in the body\n  4. Diagrams -- relationships among parts\n  5. Journaling\n  6. Direct access:\n     + Therapist to parts\n     + Self to parts\n     + Part to part\n* Imaging\n  1. Room technique\n  2. Mountain or path exercise\n  3. Going back in time with a part, then \"unburdening\"\n  4. Bringing parts into the present -- \"retrieval\"\n  5. Future imaging\n  6. Working with more than one part\n  7. Confronting abuse/significant others\n  8. Horizon/healing place\n  9. Use of light\n* Concept of Blending: keeping the feelings of the part from overwhelming the Self\n  1. Working with the Self to understand why/how not to blend\n  2. Working with the part to understand why/how not to blend\n* Working with young children\n  1. Assess developmental level of child and whether need to be concrete or able to use imaging techniques\n  2. Be creative, use modalities comfortable to child -- art, play techniques\n  3. Children respond well to techniques that externalize parts and then involve interacting with the parts, such as sandtray, puppets, and so on.\n\n**IX. WORKING WITH FAMILIES**\n\n* Introduce IFS language (power of IFS language vs. monolithic language)\n  1. Language is powerful in changing sequences.\n  2. Language frees people from seeing themselves (and others) in extreme ways.\n* Looking for parts that are activated in session.\n  1. Identifying sequences (both internal and external)\n  2. Selves working together to keep extreme parts of each family member from interfering\n* Enactments\n  1. Set up enactments of family.\n  2. Set up enactments of sequences/relationship among parts of individual family members.\n* Work with one family member while others watch.\n  1. Establish safety: Family members not to analyze parts outside of session\n  2. Contract not to talk about others' parts; can talk about own parts\n  3. No matter what others are doing, individual always responsible for own parts\n  4. Ask for reactions of others who are watching.\n  5. Try to alternate among family members.\n* Working with one member outside of family sessions\n  1. Emphasize taking responsibility for own parts and help practice accessing Self.\n* General frame of Selves working together to keep extreme parts of each family member from interfering\n\n**X. CONSTRAINTS TO THE WORK**\n\n* Therapist's parts (rational/scientific, approval, worrier, protective)\n* Protective parts of client\n* Protective parts of other family members\n* External system unsupportive or abusive\n\n**XI. COMMON THERAPIST MISTAKES**\n\n* Working with exile before system is ready.\n* Therapist assumes he/she is talking to person's Self when is talking to a part.\n* Therapist thinks Self is doing the work, but it's really a part.\n\n**XII. TROUBLESHOOTING PROBLEMS**\n\n* Helping Self to distance from/unblend from parts\n* Dealing with extreme parts\n\n**XIII. STRENGTHS OF THE MODEL**\n\n* Focuses on strengths: the undamaged core of the Self, the ability of parts to shift into positive roles\n* IFS language provides a way to look at oneself and others differently.\n* Language encourages self-disclosure and taking responsibility for behavior.\n* IFS language is powerful.\n* Provides a way to work with \"resistance\" and denial\n* Ecological understanding of entire therapy system, including therapist\n* Respect for individual's experience of the problem\n  1. Clients provide the material -- the therapist doesn't have to have all the ideas.\n  2. Therapist looks at client's Self as \"co-therapist\" and trusts the wisdom of the internal system.\n\n* [Home](/)\n* [About Us](/about-us)\n  + [Richard C.

However, as you start to attempt to navigate your internal system of parts by yourself or with a therapist, it can quickly become incredibly complex. The process can run aground in innumerable ways, often because of covert protective parts that are either Self-like, and therefore difficult to discern from the real Self, or present as intractable blocks which brings up frustrated parts of the client and anxious parts of therapist. I have chosen five of these common obstacles or blocks that stump clients and seasoned IFS-trained therapists alike. There are many ways to navigate these blocks so don't take this as a rigid \"how-to\" or as an exhaustive list. The way I work with them is not the way you necessarily will. Maybe see this as a starting point and use your own creativity and ingenuity to work with whatever comes up, remembering most protective parts stuck in extreme roles are tired, and wants the support and care from the Self.\n\n**Self-like Curiosity.**  Often clients come to IFS having completed extensive reading, or maybe having done some IFS meditations on their own. So, when they are invited inside and asked the \"How do you feel towards the part?\" befriending question, and they answer, \"curious\" but the part whom they are curious towards does not respond, or the process stalls in some ways. This may be because the part responding is an Intellectual Manager has read IFS literature, or a People-pleasing manager who knows that \"curious\" is the textbook answer. A way to navigate this is to ask for the body sensation that goes with the curiosity, or, \"Where do you feel that curiosity in your body?\" Remember, Self-energy is an embodied experience. If there is no body sensation that goes with the curiosity, or confusion comes with that question, it is likely one of the Self-like parts above is answering. You can then notice that and either ask that one to relax, or ask it what is it concerned will happen if the parts lets the Self be curious (credit to Susan McConnell, creator of Somatic IFS for this intervention).\n\n**\"I like it!\"** Sometimes when you ask the \"How do you feel towards the part?\" question, you get the answer, \"I like it!\", or \"I love it! as a respond. While on the surface this may look like an easy track to a Self-part connection, in actuality it may be an answer coming from the part you are attempting to befriend, rather than from the Self. In other words, the part is blended. Self doesn't like or love what a part is doing, it's curious about it, or compassionate towards it (or any of the other C's). As an example, sometimes while working with a substance using or addicted Firefighter that is blended with the client's Self, you will often get a response like, \"I like it, it gets me out of my head!\" This response indicates that the person is blended with the Firefighter and it is polarised with a strict Intellectual Manager. In this scenario, you can either ask the Firefighter to relax back and meet the Self, or, if it won't separate, use Direct Access and speak to it directly (credit to Martha Sweezy, the author of \"IFS for Guilt and Shame\" for this intervention).\n\n![Self-like Parts in Internal Family Systems (IFS) Therapy](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/d5441a_ed5aa1a27dbf450582778ee120cb80f0~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_147,h_221,al_c,q_80,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,blur_2,enc_avif,quality_auto/d5441a_ed5aa1a27dbf450582778ee120cb80f0~mv2.jpg)\n\n**\"Sad\".** Often when you get close to an Exile (a child part holding burdens around trauma or attachment wounds), you will ask the \"How do you feel towards the part?\" question, and the answer will come back as, \"I feel sad.\" Self does not experience sadness, so there are multiple ways to respond to the answer. Firstly, you can clarify if the sadness is coming from the Exile, or from another part that feels sad for it (or both). You can also ask if the sadness feels more \"pity\" or \"compassion\" (or both). \"Pity\" indicates a part that feels pity for the Exile, while compassion (assuming it's embodied) indicates Self-energy. Being curious, and asking more questions always reaps benefits, and drills down to the core of the person's experience (again, credit to Susan McConnell).\n\n**\"I know already\".** Because internal connections take repetition and time to build, sometimes you need to retread some ground which has already been covered in previous sessions, or if a client has told a story cognitively from a story-telling part early in the therapy. When you ask a part about itself you may get responses such as, \"I know this already\" to standard IFS befriending questions. While this may seem objectively reasonable, Self doesn't \"know\" everything, and therefore the \"I know already\" is coming from an intellectual manager who may have the cognitive information, but has fears about the emotional and somatic elements of the experience that may come up if the Self is allowed to be open and curious.\n\n**\"I don't know\".** A common obstacle for all IFS Therapists, particularly those working with trauma, is the parts that answer, \"I don't know.\" What is behind this \"not knowing\" in a system that has experienced a lot of trauma? That's a complex question, but suffice to say that dissociative barriers are necessary to survive in adverse and challenging early environments, so \"not knowing\" the full extent of your challenging experience, particularly at the hands of your caregivers, is an effective survival strategy. The \"I don't know\" can have multiple meanings and again, it's an opportunity for the therapist to be persistent, and follow up with more questions. You may like to follow up with befriending questions about the part that doesn't know, or see this as an opportunity to really slow down and give the person more space and then prompt them with, \"Take some time to really hang out with the question... and notice what comes up\". Other responses that yield further information are \"Where would you go to find the answer?\" or \"Who would you ask inside to find the answer?\" These questions will direct the system towards the information or reasons for not having access to the information.\n\nAs you can see from all the above, protective parts can be tricky, either in their Self-like ways, the manner in which they communicate or don't communicate, and the means by which they use feeling states that are usually attributable to the Self to bamboozle the therapist. The therapists best strategy is stay open and curious, and ask more questions to deepen in to the client's experience.\n\n## Recent Posts\n\n![Internal Family Systems (IFS) Therapy: Common manager roles in a shame-prone system]()\n![What are \"parts\" in Internal Family Systems (IFS) Therapy?]()\n![What are \"Self-like Parts\" in Internal Family Systems (IFS) Therapy?]()\n![Australian Assocaition Psychologists Member Logo](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/d5441a_c9423bbb535f47989abee0d156275ba3~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_240,h_125,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,enc_avif,quality_auto/MAAPi-logo-white.png)\n![ISSTD Logo](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/d5441a_1dc708568fee4b668aea8f3a46e5bf88~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_250,h_119,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,enc_avif,quality_auto/2025_-2026_Member_Logo.png)\n![Internal Family Systems (IFS) Institute Logo](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/d5441a_ad6b30a0c54748638498c3336577319b~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_198,h_119,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,enc_avif,quality_auto/IFS%20Institute_homepage_0.png)\n\n© 2025 created by Sean Cuthbert, Clinical Psychologist\n\nTitle: What is Self-Energy in Internal Family Systems Therapy?\nURL: https://www.danroberts.com/blog/what-is-self-energy-in-internal-family-systems-therapy\nContent: Self-energy in IFS is an inner resource of warmth, love, and compassion, like the sun's energy, that can be accessed to heal.\nRaw Content: ![Dan Roberts: Psychotherapist, Writer &amp; Teacher](//images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/589b12468419c22a6dc74e65/f87efbbd-3d6f-4d1b-9e04-6e64ac9dc722/Logo+4+%281%29.png?format=1500w)\n![Dan Roberts: Psychotherapist, Writer &amp; Teacher](//images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/589b12468419c22a6dc74e65/f87efbbd-3d6f-4d1b-9e04-6e64ac9dc722/Logo+4+%281%29.png?format=1500w)\n\n# What is Self-Energy in Internal Family Systems Therapy?\n\n![](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/589b12468419c22a6dc74e65/1681637717400-6IFAG89WRSEZY1HRIA9P/unsplash-image-Y4pAaS2NM3g.jpg)\n\nImage by [Sandalp Suradkar](https://unsplash.com/es/@sankalpsuradkar)\n\nOne of the core ideas in [internal family systems therapy](https://www.danroberts.com/what-is-internal-family-systems-therapy) is that we all have a Self – an inner resource of warmth, love and compassion that offers a powerful, healing energy if we can learn to access it.

Ever\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn the dynamic and often unpredictable business landscape of 2025, leadership is not just about managing teams; it’s about inspiring resilience, driving innovation, and navigating complexity with clarity. This is where the power of sophisticated **executive [coaching](https://richard-reid.com/coaching-old/ \"Coaching\") techniques** comes into play. Gone are the days of generic advice. Today’s leaders require a tailored, evidence-based approach that unlocks their full potential and directly impacts organizational success. Effective executive coaching moves beyond simple problem-solving to cultivate deep self-awareness, enhance strategic capabilities, and build lasting behavioral change. This guide provides a practical roadmap to the core techniques and frameworks that define world-class executive coaching, empowering leaders and coaches to achieve transformative results.\n\nDefine Outcomes: Aligning Coaching with Strategic Goals\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe foundation of any successful coaching engagement is clarity. Before diving into specific techniques, the coach and the executive must co-create a clear vision of success. This process ensures that personal development goals are intrinsically linked to the organization’s strategic objectives. Vague aspirations like “becoming a better leader” are replaced with specific, measurable outcomes.\n\n### Techniques for Goal Alignment\n\n*   **The 3-Way Kick-off Meeting:** This crucial session involves the executive, their direct manager (or sponsor), and the coach. The purpose is to establish a transparent agreement on the coaching objectives, how success will be measured, and the key business challenges the coaching will help address.\n*   **Goal Cascading:** The coach helps the leader map their personal development goals directly to their team’s objectives and the broader company’s strategic priorities (e.g., market expansion, digital transformation, or talent retention).\n*   **KPI-Linked Objectives:** Define coaching outcomes that can be tied to Key Performance Indicators. For instance, a goal to improve team communication could be linked to metrics like employee engagement scores or a reduction in project delays.\n\nCore Executive Coaching Frameworks for Modern Leaders\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nWhile coaching is a dynamic process, it is grounded in proven methodologies. Understanding these core frameworks allows a coach to flexibly apply the right approach for the right situation. The most effective **executive coaching techniques** for 2025 often blend elements from these three powerful approaches.\n\n### Solution-Focused Coaching\n\nThis forward-looking approach concentrates on solutions rather than problems. Instead of dissecting past failures, the focus is on identifying existing strengths and resources to build a desired future. It’s about asking, “What’s already working?” and “What would it look like if this problem were solved?” This framework is highly effective for leaders who are stuck in a cycle of problem analysis and need to shift towards action and possibility.\n\n### Cognitive-Behavioral Coaching (CBC)\n\nRooted in psychology, CBC operates on the principle that our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are interconnected. A coach using this technique helps an executive identify and challenge self-limiting beliefs or unproductive thought patterns (e.g., imposter syndrome, fear of failure) that hinder their performance. By reframing these thoughts, leaders can adopt more effective behaviors and emotional responses.\n\n### Systemic Coaching\n\nNo leader operates in a vacuum. Systemic coaching considers the entire organizational ecosystem—the team dynamics, the company culture, market pressures, and stakeholder relationships. This approach helps leaders see the bigger picture, understand the ripple effects of their decisions, and identify leverage points for change within the broader system. It’s essential for senior executives whose actions have far-reaching consequences.\n\nMastering Listening: Techniques for Deeper Insight\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nListening is arguably the most critical skill in coaching. It’s not passive; it’s a dynamic process of seeking to understand. Advanced coaching requires moving beyond simply hearing words to grasping the underlying meaning, emotions, and assumptions.\n\n### The Three Levels of Listening\n\n*   **Level 1: Internal Listening.** The focus is on our own thoughts and feelings. We hear the other person’s words, but we are primarily thinking, “What does this mean to me?” or “What should I say next?” This level is not effective for coaching.\n*   **Level 2: Focused Listening.** The focus is entirely on the other person. All your attention is directed at their words, tone, and body language. You are listening to understand, not to respond. This is the cornerstone of good coaching.\n*   **Level 3: Global Listening.** This is the most advanced level. You are not only focused on the person but also on the environment—the energy in the room, the unspoken dynamics, and the broader context. You use your intuition to sense what is not being said.\n\nPowerful Questioning: Models and Sample Prompts\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nGreat coaches don’t give answers; they ask questions that unlock the coachee’s own insights. Powerful questions are open-ended, thought-provoking, and challenge assumptions. The GROW model is a classic and effective framework for structuring a coaching conversation.\n\n| Model Stage | Purpose | Sample Questions |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **G**oal | Establish what the coachee wants to achieve. | “What would you like to have happen?” or “What does success look like for this situation?” |\n| **R**eality | Explore the current situation and context. | “What is happening now?” or “What have you already tried?” |\n| **O**ptions | Generate possibilities and alternative strategies. | “What could you do?” or “If there were no constraints, what would be your first step?” |\n| **W**ill / Way Forward | Commit to specific actions and create a plan. | “What will you do now?” or “How will you ensure you follow through?” |\n\nBeyond GROW, other powerful questions include:\n\n*   “What assumption are you making here?”\n*   “What’s the real challenge for you in this?”\n*   “If you were coaching yourself, what advice would you give?”\n\nEmotional Intelligence Development: Exercises and Measures\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\nA high EQ is a non-negotiable trait for modern executives. [Emotional Intelligence Training](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotional_intelligence) is a core component of executive coaching, focusing on the ability to perceive, use, understand, and manage emotions.\n\n### Practical EQ-Building Exercises\n\n*   **Journaling for Self-Awareness:** Encourage the leader to spend five minutes daily writing down their emotional responses to the day’s events. The prompt can be: “When did I feel most energized today? When did I feel frustrated? What triggered these feelings?”\n*   **The ‘Pause’ Practice:** Coach the executive to build a micro-habit of taking one conscious breath before reacting in a high-stakes conversation. This small gap creates the space to choose a considered response over an emotional reaction.\n*   **Empathy Mapping:** When facing a team or stakeholder conflict, have the leader create a map of what the other person might be thinking, feeling, seeing, and hearing. This exercise shifts perspective and builds empathy.\n\nStrategic Thinking Drills: Structured Habits for Leaders\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nCoaching can transform a leader from being purely operational to becoming truly strategic. This involves developing habits that foster a long-term, big-picture perspective. For more background, explore these [Strategic Thinking Skills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_management).\n\n### Habits for Strategic Acumen\n\n*   **Dedicated Thinking Time:** Coach the leader to block 60-90 minutes of “thinking time” on their calendar each week. This time is sacrosanct and used for reflecting on industry trends, competitive landscapes, and long-term opportunities, not for answering emails.\n*   **Scenario Planning Exercise:** Present a hypothetical future scenario (e.g., “A major new competitor enters your market in 2026 with a disruptive technology. What are our top three potential responses?”). This builds mental agility.\n*   **Questioning Assumptions:** Encourage the leader to regularly ask their team, “What is a core belief we hold about our business or customers that might no longer be true?”\n\nTime and Priority Coaching: Practical Productivity Techniques\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMany executives are trapped in a cycle of constant busyness. Coaching on [Time Management Skills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_management) is not about finding more hours in the day; it’s about allocating energy to the most impactful activities.\n\n### Effective Productivity Frameworks\n\n*   **The Eisenhower Matrix:** Help the leader categorize tasks into four quadrants: Urgent/Important, Not Urgent/Important, Urgent/Not Important, and Not Urgent/Not Important. The goal is to spend most of their time in the “Not Urgent/Important” quadrant, which is where strategic work happens.\n*   **Energy Management:** Coach the leader to identify their peak energy times during the day and schedule their most cognitively demanding work for those periods. Less demanding tasks can be reserved for lower-energy times.\n*   **The “One Thing” Focus:** Each week and each day, the leader should identify the single most important task that will move them closer to their strategic goals and prioritize its completion above all else.\n\nFeedback and Performance Conversations: Scripts and Frameworks\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGiving and receiving feedback is a high-leverage skill that many leaders find challenging. **Executive coaching techniques** can provide structured, less confrontational ways to handle these crucial conversations.\n\n### The SBI-D Framework\n\nA simple and powerful model for delivering clear feedback:\n\n*   **Situation:** Describe the specific context. “During this morning’s project update meeting…”\n*   **Behavior:** State the observable behavior. “…when you presented the Q3 forecast…”\n*   **Impact:** Explain the effect the behavior had on you or the team. “…the team seemed confused about the new targets, and several people asked clarifying questions afterward.”\n*   **Desired Outcome:** Clarify what you would like to see in the future. “In our next meeting, could we walk through the assumptions behind the numbers to ensure everyone is aligned?”\n\nDesigning a 90-Day Coaching Plan for Executives\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nA structured plan provides momentum and a clear path for the coaching engagement. A 90-day cycle is ideal for setting meaningful goals and seeing tangible progress.\n\n| Phase | Timeline | Focus Areas | Key Activities |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Phase 1: Discovery and Alignment** | Days 1-30 | Building trust, goal setting, and assessment. | 360-degree feedback review, 3-way kick-off meeting, values and strengths exploration, co-creating the coaching agreement and goals. |\n| **Phase 2: Action and Experimentation** | Days 31-60 | Applying new skills and behaviors. | Role-playing difficult conversations, implementing new time management systems, practicing strategic thinking drills, bi-weekly coaching sessions. |\n| **Phase 3: Integration and Review** | Days 61-90 | Embedding change and planning for the future. | Mid-point review with sponsor, identifying ongoing support structures, creating a post-coaching sustainability plan, final progress review. |\n\nMeasuring Impact: Metrics, Qualitative Indicators and Case Notes\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDemonstrating the ROI of coaching is essential. A robust measurement strategy combines quantitative data with qualitative insights.\n\n*   **Quantitative Metrics:** Track changes in business KPIs that are linked to the coaching goals. This could include team retention rates, employee engagement scores, project success rates, or sales targets.\n*   **Qualitative Indicators:** Use 360-degree feedback surveys at the beginning and end of the engagement to gather perspectives on behavioral change. Collect testimonials and anecdotal evidence from the leader, their manager, and direct reports.\n*   **Coach’s Case Notes:** The coach should maintain structured session notes that track progress against goals, key insights, and actions committed to by the leader. This creates a narrative of the coaching journey.\n\nCommon Obstacles in Executive Coaching and Response Strategies\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEven with the best **coaching strategies**, challenges will arise. A skilled coach anticipates and navigates these obstacles effectively.\n\n*   **Resistance to Feedback:** If a leader is defensive, the coach should re-establish psychological safety. Use questions like, “What part of this feedback, if any, might be true?” to open a small window for reflection.\n*   **Lack of Time:** If an executive consistently cancels sessions, the coach should address this directly as a coaching topic. The conversation can be framed around priority management and commitment, linking it back to their original goals.\n*   **Unclear Goals:** If the engagement loses focus, revisit the initial goal-setting phase. Ask, “What’s the most important thing we should be working on right now to help you achieve your primary objective?”\n\nQuick Daily Micro-Practices to Embed Behavior Change\n----------------------------------------------------\n\nLasting change comes from consistent practice, not occasional grand gestures. These simple, under-2-minute practices help integrate coaching insights into daily leadership.\n\n*   **The Daily Highlight:** At the start of each day, the leader identifies the one most important thing they need to accomplish. This builds intentionality.\n*   **The “Plus/Delta” End-of-Day Reflection:** Before logging off, the leader takes 60 seconds to note one thing that went well (“plus”) and one thing they would change or do differently tomorrow (“delta”).\n*   **One Appreciative Inquiry Question:** Encourage the leader to ask one team member a positive, open-ended question each day, such as, “What’s a small win you’ve had this week that we haven’t celebrated yet?”\n\nAppendix: Templates, Prompts and Checklists\n-------------------------------------------\n\n### Pre-Session Preparation Template for Leaders\n\n*   What has been my biggest success since our last session?\n*   What has been my biggest challenge?\n*   What progress have I made on my action items?\n*   What is the single most important topic I need to discuss today?\n\n### Powerful Reflection Prompts\n\n*   What story am I telling myself about this situation?\n*   What would I do if I knew I could not fail?\n*   Who do I need to be in this moment to achieve the outcome I want?\n*   What is this situation teaching me?\n\n### Coach’s Pre-Session Checklist\n\n*   Review notes from the previous session.\n*   Re-read the coachee’s stated long-term goals.\n*   Check in on progress towards key milestones.\n*   Prepare 2-3 powerful, open-ended questions based on recent progress and challenges.\n*   Set a clear intention for the session: What do I want to help the coachee achieve today?\n\nRelated posts\n-------------\n\n[![Image 3](https://richard-reid.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/file-18.jpeg)](https://richard-reid.com/performance-coaching-playbook-for-managers/)\n\nWhitepapers\n\n### [Performance Coaching Playbook for Managers](https://richard-reid.com/performance-coaching-playbook-for-managers/)\n\n[![Image 4](https://richard-reid.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/file-17.jpeg)](https://richard-reid.com/performance-coaching-blueprint-for-sustainable-results/)\n\nWhitepapers\n\n### [Performance Coaching Blueprint for Sustainable Results](https://richard-reid.com/performance-coaching-blueprint-for-sustainable-results/)\n\n[![Image 5](https://richard-reid.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/file-16.jpeg)](https://richard-reid.com/conflict-resolution-strategies-for-teams-and-managers/)\n\nWhitepapers\n\n### [Conflict Resolution Strategies for Teams and Managers](https://richard-reid.com/conflict-resolution-strategies-for-teams-and-managers/)\n\n[![Image 6](https://richard-reid.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/file-15.jpeg)](https://richard-reid.com/career-crafting-daily-routines-for-professional-development/)\n\nWhitepapers\n\n### [Career Crafting: Daily Routines for Professional Development](https://richard-reid.com/career-crafting-daily-routines-for-professional-development/)\n\n[![Image 7](https://richard-reid.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/file-14.jpeg)](https://richard-reid.com/practical-pathways-to-professional-growth-and-career-mastery/)\n\nWhitepapers\n\n### [Practical Pathways to Professional Growth and Career Mastery](https://richard-reid.com/practical-pathways-to-professional-growth-and-career-mastery/)\n\n[![Image 8](https://richard-reid.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/file-13.jpeg)](https://richard-reid.com/practical-professional-development-plan-for-emerging-leaders/)\n\nWhitepapers\n\n### [Practical Professional Development Plan for Emerging Leaders](https://richard-reid.com/practical-professional-development-plan-for-emerging-leaders/)\n\nContact Us Today\n\nToday, discover how Richard Reid can profoundly improve your leadership journey and organizational success.

How is it applied in coaching?\n=======================================================================\n\nPosted June 28th, 2023\n\n[Back to Blog](https://www.engagecoach.com/blog)\n**Introduction to the GROW model**\n----------------------------------\n\n### _Importance of Coaching in Personal and Professional Development_\n\nCoaching is without a doubt one of the fastest growing methods used to develop people both personally and professionally. Executed properly, it can have a significant and profound impact on a person psychologically and behaviourally. Coaching brings a structured framework which facilitates progress towards goals and outcomes, whether these are learning or performance outcomes, professional outcomes or more specific career related goals.\n\n### _Overview of the GROW Model_\n\nThe GROW Model was first published by Sir John Whitmore in 1992 and is an acronym which represents 4 stages of a coaching process, **G**oals,**R**eality, **O**ptions, **W**ay forward. This model due to its simplicity has become one of the most commonly used methods within coaching.\n\n**Understanding the GROW Model**\n--------------------------------\n\n### _Definition and Origins of the GROW Model_\n\nTo apply the GROW model within your coaching practice it is important to understand what the different stages of the process refer to. There are 4 stages which follow a sequence that can be repeated as the coaching evolves.\n\n### _The Four Stages of the GROW Model_\n\n1.   #### Goal Setting\n\n**_Setting Clear and Specific Goals_**\n\nThe letter G in the model, represents the goal setting stage. This stage is all about getting clear on goals and setting goals which are specific and measurable. Goal setting theory underpins this stage of the model which recognises the importance of goal setting and motivation on task performance (Locke and Latham, 1990)\n\n**_Establishing SMART Goals_**\n\nA further acronym which is also commonly used at this stage of the GROW Model is SMART goals. SMART goals are goals which are specific, measurable, achievable, relevant and time bound. The research that underpins SMART goals again draws on the work of psychologists Locke and Latham in the 1970’s. This research suggests that the more specific we are when we set goals, the more likely we are to be successful in achieving them.\n\n1.   #### Reality Check\n\n**_Assessing the Current Situation_**\n\nThe second stage of the GROW Model is represented by the letter R, which refers to ‘reality check’. This stage is all about exploring where the current reality is. This is about examining the starting point, and establishing a benchmark. This becomes valuable when measuring progress and being able to explore how to move forward from the current reality.\n\n**_Identifying Obstacles and Challenges_**\n\nIt is important when establishing the current reality of a situation to be honest and realistic about the obstacles and challenges that may exist that could interfere with progress.\n\n1.   #### Options Generation\n\n**_Exploring Different Paths and Possibilities_**\n\nThe third stage of the GROW Model is represented by O, which is about generating options. Having established a goal, and explored the current reality, the next step is to generate options. What are the possibilities and options for achieving the goal, how can you remove the obstacles and deal with the challenges.\n\n**_Encouraging Creativity and Brainstorming_**\n\nThe options stage of the GROW model is all about brainstorming ideas and being creative. This is a very empowering stage which explores and opens up possibilities for moving forward and closer to your goals.\n\n1.   #### Way Forward\n\n**_Developing Action Plans_**\n\nThe W stage of the model, refers to making a Way Forward. This is about generating and committing to a plan. Creating an action plan makes the process more tangible and concrete and starts to bring some accountability to the process.\n\n**_Defining Strategies and Tactics for Success_**\n\nThis stage of the process is about defining a strategy for success, and creating a tangible plan to realise the goal. The previous stages have created a foundation for this stage. The goal has been established at stage 1, stage 2 explored the current reality and established the start point, stage 3 explored the available options for achieving the goal and uncovered any obstacles and now at stage 4 this is about creating the strategy and plan for making the goal a reality.\n\n**Applying the GROW Model in Coaching Sessions**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n### _Establishing a Coaching Relationship_\n\nWhen applying the GROW model within your coaching practice there are several factors to consider which relate to the coaching relationship.\n\n1.   #### Building Rapport and Trust\n\nTo be effective in coaching, the coach needs to establish trust and rapport. These are core characteristics and have long been recognised as fundamental to coaching success in the coaching research literature (Skiffington and Zeus, 2001; Bush, 2004; Sztucinski, 2001; Guthrie, 1999; Kilburg, 2000; Caprioni, 2001; Kappenberg, 2008). Building rapport is the start of the coaching relationship which helps put the coachee at ease and supports the process of building trust. Establishing trust is one of the core foundations within coaching, which facilitates openness.\n\n1.   #### Setting Expectations and Boundaries\n\nA further important aspect to consider in terms of effective coaching is setting expectations and boundaries (Crane, 2001). This removes uncertainty and creates a strong layer of professionalism, which avoids assumptions and creates clarity about what coaching is and importantly what it is NOT. Establishing these boundaries and being clear to manage expectations provides a solid foundation for the coaching relationship which helps to eliminate potential problems further down the process.\n\n### _Goal Setting Phase_\n\n1.   #### Defining Long-Term and Short-Term Goals\n\nWhen setting goals using the GROW model, it can be useful to reflect on this in terms of defining short, and longer term goals. Short term goals facilitate some immediate gains and help to build momentum from the beginning. Longer term goals provide a broader focus that provides direction over time and may involve more time to achieve them.\n\n1.   #### Using SMART Criteria for Goal Development\n\nIt is also important to ensure that any goal whether this is short or longer term follows the principles of SMART criteria. Using SMART goals helps make the goal a reality by providing a clear structure which makes the goal concrete.\n\n### _Reality Check Phase_\n\n1.   #### Assessing Current Skills and Resources\n\nWhen in phase two, which is reality checking, this is where you establish what the current state of play is. This is about identifying what skills and resources are needed to achieve the goal, which will uncover if there are any gaps to fill.\n\n1.   #### Identifying Limiting Beliefs and Assumptions\n\nWithin this stage it is also useful to uncover any limiting beliefs or assumptions that may be present that could derail the process. Limiting beliefs are beliefs that we hold about ourselves that undermine us and hold us back from achieving our goals. This is often discussed as being the ‘negative voice in our head’ that stops us from doing something. Assumptions differ in that they are beliefs that we hold about something that may not be verified or validated. As such, when we have an assumption, we take this belief as being a ‘true’ representation of something, without having any proof to validate this.\n\n### _Options Generation Phase_\n\n1.   #### Encouraging Creative Thinking and Problem Solving\n\nDuring phase three of the model this is where we are generating options, and have freedom to get creative. This phase seeks to solve problems, overcome challenges and remove limiting beliefs. This is where we generate ideas and options that introduce choice and open up possibilities.\n\n1.   #### Exploring Different Perspectives and Solutions\n\nAs part of the option stage, we are also seeking to explore different perspectives and find solutions that will eliminate any obstacles to achieving the goal. These obstacles may exist in the external environment such as needing a certain qualification, or they may be within ourselves in terms of our mindset.\n\n### _Way Forward Phase_\n\nThe final stage of the GROW model is about setting the way forward. This is done by creating a strategy and plan of action. This plan would include removing obstacles, or taking small measurable steps towards the goal.\n\n1.   #### Developing Action Plans with Clear Steps\n\nA solid action plan will have clear steps to it. These will be small, incremental steps that take you closer to the end goal. It is important to break the steps down into small tasks, as this stops the end goal feeling overwhelming and enables you to move forward and make progress.\n\n1.   #### Setting Accountability and Tracking Progress\n\nA very important part of any action plan is to set some measures that track progress and have elements of accountability. Having someone to report to, such as a boss or a coach, is important. We are often more willing to invest the time and not want to let someone else down, which helps us follow through on the action plan. Finding ways to measure progress is also important as this allows us to see if we are moving towards or away from our end goal. Tracking progress and being able to measure the gains is also very motivational and helps us stay committed to the goal.\n\nTips for Effective Coaching Using the GROW Model\n------------------------------------------------\n\nThere are some useful things to reflect on when using the GROW Model that can help make this process more effective. These include:\n\n### _\\_Active Listening and Powerful Questioning\\__\n\nActive listening and asking powerful questions are core characteristics of any successful coaching approach. Active listening involves hearing what is being said, and showing recognition of this by being able to make relevant observations and ask powerful questions. A powerful question is a question that forces the person to reflect on things that will help them gain an insight or challenge their own thinking about something. Invariably a powerful question requires a more detailed response as opposed to a yes, or no response.\n\n### _Providing Constructive Feedback and Support_\n\nAnother important aspect to effective coaching is to provide constructive feedback and support to the coachee (Crane, 2001; Grant, 2001) . Constructive feedback involves offering feedback that brings challenge and critique but with a positive intent. Offering support is important, as people will often find critique more challenging to deal with, where support softens this approach.\n\n### _Balancing Support and Challenge_\n\nIt is however, important to get the balance right. Too much support may lead to collusion and avoid some of the more difficult conversations that are needed. Often we need challenge within coaching to drive change. Challenge with support stimulates change in a productive and positive way.\n\n### _Flexibility and Adaptability in Coaching Approach_\n\nWhilst the GROW Model is a useful way to bring consistency of approach, effective coaching also needs to recognise that each coachee will bring a different set of characteristics and context to the coaching relationship. Therefore, being flexible and adaptable in the coaching approach is important to accommodate these differences.\n\n**Conclusion**\n--------------\n\nIn summary, the GROW Model is an established methodology that is commonly used in coaching. It provides a clear structure and framework for any coaching approach that can be easily integrated with other methods. It is simple to use and ensures a more detailed approach to goal attainment, bringing accountability and supporting both the coach and coachee to track progress and measure results.\n\nIf you want to learn more about the GROW model, then check out our [mindset training course](https://www.engagecoach.com/mindset-training-course/).

You use them to guide conversations and spark new ideas.\n\nThey’re open-ended and encourage reflection.\n\nGood coaching questions don’t have simple yes or no answers. They make you pause and consider things from new angles.\n\nYou might ask about goals, challenges, or past experiences.\n\nHere are some examples of coaching questions:\n\n1.   What do you want to achieve?\n2.   How will you know when you’ve succeeded?\n3.   What’s stopping you from moving forward?\n4.   What have you learned from past setbacks?\n5.   Who could support you in reaching your goal?\n\nThese questions help explore options and come up with solutions. They’re different from giving advice or telling someone what to do.\n\nInstead, they empower people to find their own path.\n\nCoaches use these questions in many settings. You might hear them in work meetings, sports training, or personal development sessions.\n\nThe goal is always to help others grow and improve.\n\nHow to Ask Coaching Questions\n-----------------------------\n\nAsking good coaching questions is a skill you can develop.\n\nStart by creating a safe space for open dialogue. Show genuine interest in the person you’re coaching.\n\nUse open-ended questions that encourage reflection. “What” and “how” questions work well. They prompt deeper thinking about situations and options.\n\n[Listen actively](https://www.universalcoachinstitute.com/active-listening/) without interrupting. Pay attention to both verbal and non-verbal cues. This helps you ask relevant follow-up questions.\n\nTiming matters when asking questions. Give the person time to process and respond. Don’t rapid-fire multiple questions at once.\n\nFrame questions positively. Instead of “Why did you fail?” try “What did you learn from that experience?”. This approach is more constructive.\n\nAvoid leading questions that suggest a specific answer. The goal is to help the person reach their own insights and conclusions.\n\nTry using [scaling questions](https://www.universalcoachinstitute.com/scaling-questions/) on a 1-10 scale.\n\nFor example: “On a scale of 1-10, how confident are you about this decision?” This provides a concrete way to measure progress.\n\nRemember, effective coaching isn’t about having all the answers. It’s about asking the right questions to help others find their own solutions.\n\n10 Best Coaching Questions\n--------------------------\n\n1.   What do you want to achieve?\n2.

How does [inquiry-based learning transform education](https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1241559.pdf) in this setting?\n\nInquiry-based learning is an [unorthodox method](https://resilienteducator.com/classroom-resources/learning-revolution-transformational-teaching/) in the typical classroom. This style actively engages students in every stage of the learning process. It works well across multiple subjects in [increasingly diverse classrooms](https://www.exploratorium.edu/education/ifi/inquiry-and-eld), and your students choose the topic to be covered. As the teacher, you assume the role of a guide or facilitator to student-led discussions, ensuring students remain on-task and aligned with the goal of the lesson.\n\n**The five guiding questions of inquiry are:**\n\nIn a standard classroom, most instruction occurs in a passive format through lecture, videos, or workbook-style assignments. Your students are the receivers of the information presented, not collaborators. Assessment of their retention is through objective questioning and assignments.\n\nThe **Johns Hopkins Center for Educational Resources (CER)** supports devoting time to active learning projects as one way to get your students sharing information in your classroom. They publish a series called [The Innovative Instructor](https://cer.jhu.edu/publications/innovative-instructor), which explores ways to incorporate this teaching style into your instruction. In our ever-evolving knowledge-based society, the skills fostered and utilized through inquiry-based learning help cultivate independent thinkers and prepare students for success.\n\n## **Benefits of inquiry-based learning**\n\nStudents who are invited to [engage in inquiry-based learning](https://ouri.rice.edu/faculty-resources/pedagogy-inquiry) often become adept at critical thinking. Using this method in your classroom can be an effective way to cultivate independent thought and allow your students to take ownership of their path to learning.\n\n**More specifically, inquiry-based learning:**\n\nThis [student-centered approach](https://inspiredteaching.org/wp-content/uploads/impact-research-briefs-inquiry-based-teaching.pdf) can take various forms, from small-scale classroom discussions to larger research projects. It can be used in science and social studies classes, along with literary discussions and civic responsibility. The key lies in you being willing to relinquish some control to allow your students to lead the discussion.\n\n[Students highly value instruction](https://www.facultyfocus.com/articles/teaching-and-learning/inquiry-based-approaches-what-do-students-think/) that partners them with their peers. They love the opportunity to become the expert and assume the role of the examiner who asks the questions, and motivated students almost always learn more.\n\n## **How inquiry questioning compares to rote teaching**\n\n[Inquiry questioning presents a contrasting style to the rote teaching](https://www.edweek.org/teaching-learning/students-learn-more-from-inquiry-based-teaching-international-study-finds/2019/10) method used in most classrooms today. The latter was developed to streamline the educational process and create a more efficient way to impart information. Unfortunately, it has also led to a lack of interest and engagement in the learning process and a reduction in the development of critical thinkers.\n\n**The inquiry-based questioning method:**\n\nContrasting these features is the **rote method of teaching,** which:\n\nThe effectiveness of each method depends on the educational goals, subjects being taught, and learning preferences of the students, as well as your unique teaching style.

Teachers can model this by using Socratic questioning techniques that prompt deeper thinking and invite multiple perspectives. Tools like the Question Formulation Technique (QFT) help students learn how to craft, categorize, and refine their own questions—turning passive learners into curious investigators. Encourage students to recognize the difference between closed (fact-based) and open-ended (exploratory) questions, and help them shift toward the latter [...] ## What is Inquiry-Based Learning?\n\nInquiry-Based Learning (IBL) is a student-centered approach to education that flips the traditional model of passive instruction. Instead of memorizing facts or following a set curriculum without context, students take an active role in their learning by asking questions, engaging in hands-on exploration, and seeking answers through investigation and reflection. [...] ## The Bottom Line\n\nInquiry-based learning transforms education. Instead of being passive recipients of knowledge, students become active participants in their own learning journey. It shifts the question from \"What do I need to know?\" to \"What do I want to find out?\"\nRaw Content:  How to Use in the Classroom — Schools That Lead\n\n[0](/cart)\n\nAdvancing powerful student learning\n\n# How to Use Inquiry-Based Learning in the Classroom\n\nWhat if your students were the ones asking the questions, driving discussions, and solving problems—without ever asking, \"Will this be on the test?\"\n\nImagine a classroom buzzing with curiosity—where students eagerly dive into big questions, investigate real-world challenges, and take ownership of their learning. That’s the power of inquiry-based learning. It shifts the traditional model of instruction from teacher-led lectures to student-driven exploration. Rather than passively receiving facts, students actively engage with content, formulate their own questions, test ideas, and draw conclusions.\n\nThis model not only boosts academic achievement but also cultivates essential life skills—critical thinking, creativity, collaboration, and resilience. Inquiry-based learning invites students to wrestle with ambiguity, pursue their passions, and develop a lifelong love of learning. It works across subjects and grade levels, whether you're teaching science in high school, language arts in middle school, or math in an elementary classroom.\n\nIn this guide, we’ll explore the core principles of inquiry-based learning, unpack why it’s so effective, and share classroom-tested strategies to help you implement it successfully—starting today.\n\n## **Key Insights**\n\n* **Inquiry-based learning**: A student-centered approach where questions, exploration, and investigation drive the learning process.\n* **Fuels engagement**: Helps students take ownership of their learning through curiosity and collaboration.\n* **Scaffolded support**: Teachers act as facilitators, offering guidance without dictating the learning path.\n* **Adaptable**: Works across all grade levels and subjects, from science experiments to social justice projects.\n* **Evidence-based**: Backed by research for improving critical thinking, retention, and academic achievement.\n\n## What is Inquiry-Based Learning?\n\nInquiry-Based Learning (IBL) is a student-centered approach to education that flips the traditional model of passive instruction. Instead of memorizing facts or following a set curriculum without context, students take an active role in their learning by asking questions, engaging in hands-on exploration, and seeking answers through investigation and reflection.\n\nAt its core, IBL fosters intellectual curiosity. It invites students to explore big ideas, make connections to real-world issues, and construct understanding by doing—much like scientists, historians, or journalists. Whether they’re conducting experiments, analyzing primary sources, or solving real-world problems, students are guided by inquiry rather than told what to think.\n\nThis approach develops essential skills for lifelong learning, including critical thinking, problem-solving, collaboration, and resilience. It also helps students see the relevance of their learning beyond the classroom, making them more invested and engaged in the process.\n\n## The 4 Types of Inquiry-based Learning\n\nInquiry-based learning isn’t a one-size-fits-all strategy. It includes varying levels of structure, each designed to match students' readiness and support gradual independence:\n\n### Confirmation Inquiry\n\nStudents are provided with the question, method, and outcome—usually to reinforce a previously introduced concept. This level helps students build confidence and familiarity with the inquiry process by practicing how to follow a structured investigation.\n\n### Structured Inquiry\n\nTeachers provide the question and the procedure, but students must analyze the data and draw their own conclusions. This approach supports students in learning how to think critically and interpret findings without the pressure of designing the entire investigation.\n\n### Guided Inquiry\n\nThe teacher presents only the research question. Students are responsible for designing and carrying out their investigation. This method encourages autonomy and creative thinking, as students choose how to approach the problem and gather evidence.\n\n### Open Inquiry\n\nThe most student-directed model, open inquiry places full responsibility on students to generate questions, design methods, conduct research, and communicate findings. It mirrors real-world research and innovation, developing higher-order thinking skills and fostering deep engagement.\n\nEach type of inquiry plays a valuable role in the classroom. By moving along this continuum—from teacher-led to student-driven—educators can scaffold learning and gradually release responsibility, helping students become confident, independent thinkers.\n\n## Why Inquiry-Based Learning Works\n\nInquiry-Based Learning (IBL) is not just a method—it’s a mindset that transforms classrooms into spaces where students are active participants in their own education. Its power lies in how it taps into students’ natural curiosity, cultivates essential life skills, and ensures that every learner sees themselves as capable and valued.\n\n### Engages the Whole Student\n\n Inquiry-based learning reaches beyond academics by engaging students both emotionally and intellectually. When students have ownership over the questions being explored, they connect more deeply with the content. Learning becomes less about completing tasks for a grade and more about satisfying genuine curiosity. This emotional investment fuels motivation and resilience—even when the learning gets hard.\n\n### Supports Deeper Understanding\n\n IBL shifts the focus from memorization to meaning-making. Rather than passively receiving information, students interact with content, test ideas, analyze multiple viewpoints, and construct their own understanding. These cognitive processes support long-term retention and foster skills like synthesis, reasoning, and adaptability. Students don’t just learn *what* to think—they learn *how* to think.\n\n### Builds Transferable Skills\n\n Inquiry-based classrooms mirror the real world. Students learn how to research, evaluate evidence, collaborate with peers, present their findings, and reflect on their process. These skills—critical thinking, communication, teamwork, and creative problem-solving—are highly valued in both higher education and the modern workforce. IBL helps students become not just better learners, but better thinkers and citizens.\n\n### Improves Equity and Inclusion\n\n IBL inherently values student voice. Because it starts with students' own questions and experiences, it naturally brings diverse perspectives into the learning process. This inclusivity is especially powerful for historically underserved students, who may not always see their identities reflected in traditional curricula. By allowing multiple ways to engage with content and demonstrate learning, IBL creates a more equitable classroom environment where every student feels seen, heard, and capable.\n\n### **How to Structure Inquiry-Based Lessons**\n\nInquiry-based learning thrives on thoughtful structure. While it empowers students to take the lead, a strong framework ensures that their exploration remains purposeful and productive. Whether you're teaching elementary students or high schoolers, the following five steps can help you design lessons that inspire curiosity and deepen understanding.\n\n**Step 1: Start with a Provocation**\n\n Kick off your lesson with something that disrupts the ordinary—a vivid image, surprising statistic, short film clip, hands-on object, or even a puzzling scenario. This initial “hook” should challenge assumptions or raise questions that aren’t easily answered. For example, showing students a video of ocean plastic pollution might prompt questions about global waste systems, sustainability, or consumer habits. The goal is to ignite curiosity and create a need to know more.\n\n**Step 2: Encourage Student Questions**\n\n After the provocation, open the floor for student inquiry. Encourage learners to generate open-ended questions—ones that can’t be answered with a simple “yes” or “no.” Use tools like a Wonder Wall, Question Formulation Technique (QFT), or collaborative whiteboarding to capture their thoughts. Instead of jumping in with answers, model how to ask better questions and refine them for investigation. This step empowers students to take ownership of their learning journey from the very beginning.\n\n**Step 3: Guide the Investigation**\n\n Once students select a driving question or theme, they begin the process of exploring and investigating. This phase can include research, experiments, surveys, expert interviews, reading primary sources, or exploring real-world data. While students lead the inquiry, the teacher plays a critical role in scaffolding their experience—offering resources, guiding research skills, and ensuring academic rigor. Think of yourself as a facilitator or coach, helping students stay focused while allowing space for exploration.\n\n**Step 4: Reflect and Discuss**\n\n Reflection is what transforms experience into learning. Set aside time for students to think deeply about what they’ve discovered and how they got there. Use learning journals, group debriefs, or reflection protocols like “I used to think… now I think…” to support metacognition. Peer discussions at this stage help refine understanding and introduce new perspectives. Encourage students to articulate how their thinking has evolved and what new questions they now have.\n\n**Step 5: Share and Act**\n\n The final phase is where students apply their learning and make it visible. This could be through a class presentation, digital portfolio, blog post, gallery walk, or even a community action project. Sharing their work not only validates their efforts but also reinforces the idea that learning has purpose beyond the classroom. When students connect their knowledge to real-world action—such as writing to local officials, creating awareness campaigns, or designing prototypes—they see themselves as capable changemakers.\n\n## Classroom Strategies for Inquiry-Based Learning\n\nImplementing inquiry-based learning (IBL) effectively requires a balance of structure, creativity, and responsiveness to student needs. Below are strategies that help educators foster curiosity, develop critical thinking, and support all learners through the inquiry process.\n\n### Use Questioning Techniques\n\n Inquiry begins with great questions. Teachers can model this by using Socratic questioning techniques that prompt deeper thinking and invite multiple perspectives. Tools like the Question Formulation Technique (QFT) help students learn how to craft, categorize, and refine their own questions—turning passive learners into curious investigators. Encourage students to recognize the difference between closed (fact-based) and open-ended (exploratory) questions, and help them shift toward the latter as they grow more comfortable with inquiry.\n\n### Integrate Technology Thoughtfully\n\n Digital tools can powerfully enhance inquiry-based learning when used with intention. Platforms like **Google Forms** allow students to conduct surveys and gather authentic data, while **Padlet** and **Flip** offer collaborative spaces for sharing reflections, multimedia responses, and evolving ideas. In STEAM classes, **Sphero robots** bring coding, engineering, and science together in interactive investigations. The key is to use tech to support exploration—not to replace curiosity with automation.\n\n### Connect to Real-World Contexts\n\n The most powerful inquiries are rooted in real life. Design units around authentic, relevant problems—climate change, local pollution, public transportation, or housing affordability. Students are more motivated when they see how their learning can address real-world issues. Consider exploring local community challenges or news stories as entry points, and invite guest speakers, community leaders, or parents to share perspectives and expertise. Authentic contexts make learning meaningful and build civic engagement.\n\n### Scaffold the Process\n\n While inquiry emphasizes student agency, many learners need structured support—especially when first engaging in self-directed learning. Provide tools such as **checklists, graphic organizers**, and **sentence stems** to help students plan and reflect. Anchor charts can outline steps in the inquiry process, and journals can guide reflection. Over time, gradually reduce scaffolds as students demonstrate increased independence, allowing them to take fuller control of their learning journey.\n\n### Create a Safe Learning Environment\n\n Inquiry thrives in classrooms where students feel emotionally safe and intellectually supported. Foster a culture where it’s okay to ask “Why?” and “What if?”—and even “I don’t know yet.” Encourage respectful dialogue, active listening, and constructive feedback. Normalize mistakes as part of learning, and celebrate intellectual risk-taking. When students trust that their voices matter and their curiosity is welcomed, they are far more likely to dive deeply into inquiry.\n\n## Common Challenges and How to Overcome Them\n\n### Classroom Management\n\n Inquiry time can get noisy—and that’s a good thing. But it needs structure. Use consistent routines and clear expectations. Create group norms and contracts to keep students focused and accountable. Assign roles in collaborative groups, such as researcher, recorder, or discussion leader, to ensure equitable participation and clear responsibilities.\n\n### Assessment\n\n Traditional tests often fail to capture the depth of inquiry learning. Instead, use **rubrics** that assess critical thinking, collaboration, and creativity. Incorporate **student reflections, portfolios, learning journals, and project presentations**. Invite students to self-assess and set goals. This approach not only measures learning more authentically but also reinforces metacognitive skills.\n\n### Curriculum Alignment\n\n One common myth is that inquiry learning doesn’t align with required standards. In reality, many national and state standards emphasize skills like analysis, reasoning, communication, and problem-solving—all core outcomes of inquiry. Backwards design is key: begin with the standards, then craft inquiries that guide students toward those outcomes while allowing for exploration.\n\n### Time Constraints\n\n Not every inquiry has to be a full-blown, weeks-long project. Try “mini inquiries” that span a day or two, or embed short inquiry cycles into existing lessons. For example, a short inquiry into “Why do shadows change throughout the day?” can be part of a science unit on light and time. With thoughtful planning, even tight schedules can accommodate meaningful inquiry.\n\n### Examples of Inquiry-Based Learning in Action\n\n### Science\n\n In a middle school unit on environmental science, students examine the question: “How can we ensure access to clean water in our community?” They design and test their own water filtration systems using everyday materials, analyze water samples, and present their designs to local leaders.\n\n### Language Arts\n\n High school students studying a novel such as *To Kill a Mockingbird* develop essential questions like “What does justice mean in different communities?” They research historical and current legal cases, conduct interviews, and create multimedia projects that connect literature to modern-day issues.\n\n### Social Studies\n\n In a government class, students take on roles in a simulated town hall to debate a current local issue—such as adding a bike lane or developing a new park. They research stakeholder positions, prepare arguments, and present proposed solutions to a panel of teachers or local officials.\n\n### STEAM\n\n Students in an upper elementary class use **Sphero robots** to explore planetary motion. They program the robots to simulate orbits, calculate speed and distance, and then reflect on how their models represent real astronomical systems.\n\n### Elementary\n\n First graders investigate the question: “What do plants need to grow?” Through classroom gardens, observations, journaling, and group discussions, they learn about sunlight, soil, and water—while developing early science inquiry habits.\n\n## The Bottom Line\n\nInquiry-based learning transforms education. Instead of being passive recipients of knowledge, students become active participants in their own learning journey. It shifts the question from \"What do I need to know?\" to \"What do I want to find out?\"\n\nWhen you make space for curiosity, inquiry, and critical thinking, you help students build the confidence and skills to navigate an unpredictable world. Inquiry isn’t just a method—it’s a mindset. And once your classroom embraces it, the possibilities are endless.\n\n## FAQs\n\n**What is the main goal of inquiry-based learning?** To develop students’ ability to ask meaningful questions, think critically, and construct knowledge through investigation.\n\n**Can inquiry-based learning work in large classes?** Yes.

The traditional model of education, where students are passive recipients of knowledge, is giving way to a more dynamic, engaging approach: inquiry-based learning. This educational philosophy transforms learners from spectators into active participants in their own discovery process. It’s about fostering curiosity, encouraging critical thinking, and empowering students to construct their own understanding by exploring questions, problems, and scenarios.\n\nThis comprehensive guide moves beyond theory to provide a practical toolkit of **strategies for inquiry based learning**. We will explore nine distinct, actionable approaches that you can implement to ignite curiosity and deepen comprehension. Each strategy is designed to shift the focus from rote memorization to meaningful exploration, ensuring students not only learn content but also develop essential lifelong skills like problem-solving, collaboration, and analytical reasoning.\n\nWithin this roundup, you will find a detailed breakdown of each method, including:\n\n* **Step-by-step implementation guides** for classroom or group settings.\n* **Practical assessment tips** to measure understanding effectively.\n* **Sample activities and lesson outlines** to get you started immediately.\n* **Specific examples** demonstrating how a tool like the geography game EarthChasers can be used to support and enhance each inquiry model.\n\nWhether you are an educator, a trivia enthusiast, or a gamer passionate about learning, this article provides the concrete strategies needed to cultivate a true spirit of inquiry. Prepare to explore techniques ranging from Problem-Based Learning and the Socratic Method to Community-Based Inquiry, all designed to build a more engaging and effective learning environment.\n\n## 1. Strategy 1: Question-Based Inquiry Learning\n\nQuestion-Based Inquiry Learning is a foundational strategy where the entire learning process is propelled by questions. Instead of teachers delivering facts for memorization, students actively formulate and investigate questions, transforming them from passive recipients into active constructors of knowledge. This approach places the art of questioning at the very core of the educational experience.\n\nThe process begins with a central, compelling question, which can be posed by the teacher (structured inquiry) or developed by the students themselves (open inquiry). This initial spark ignites curiosity and provides a clear direction for investigation. As students delve deeper, they generate their own sub-questions, guiding their research, experiments, and discussions. This is a core component of effective **strategies for inquiry based learning**, as it fosters critical thinking and intellectual autonomy.\n\n### Implementation in the Classroom\n\nTo successfully implement this strategy, focus on creating an environment where curiosity is valued and questioning is encouraged.\n\n* **Start with a \"Wonder Wall\":** Dedicate a space in the classroom where students can post questions about a new topic. This visual collection becomes a roadmap for the unit's exploration.\n* **Teach Question Formulation:** Use frameworks like the \"Question Formulation Technique\" (QFT) to guide students in crafting both open-ended (divergent) and closed-ended (convergent) questions. Differentiate between \"thick\" questions that require deep analysis and \"thin\" questions that can be answered with a simple fact.\n* **Structure the Investigation:** Provide resources and a framework for students to find answers. This could involve curated articles, lab stations, expert interviews, or digital tools. The goal is to facilitate their search, not to provide the answers directly.\n\n### Using EarthChasers to Support this Strategy\n\nThe *EarthChasers* trivia game is an excellent tool for stimulating Question-Based Inquiry. After a game round focused on a specific region, like the Amazon Rainforest, a teacher can leverage the game's content to spark deeper questions.\n\nFor example, a question about Brazil’s deforestation rates might lead a student to ask, \"What are the main economic drivers of deforestation in the Amazon?\" This student-generated question becomes the starting point for a research project, moving far beyond the initial trivia fact. A teacher can then challenge the student to create a new, more complex *EarthChasers* question based on their findings, completing the inquiry cycle.\n\n## 2. Problem-Based Learning (PBL)\n\nProblem-Based Learning (PBL) flips the traditional \"learn then apply\" model on its head. In this strategy, students are presented with a complex, open-ended, real-world problem *before* they receive any direct instruction on the topic. The problem itself becomes the vehicle for learning, compelling students to identify knowledge gaps and seek out the information needed to develop a viable solution.\n\nThis approach transforms the learning process into a mission-driven investigation. Instead of memorizing isolated facts, students learn content within the context of its application, fostering deeper understanding and long-term retention. PBL is one of the most effective **strategies for inquiry based learning** because it inherently requires students to ask questions, conduct research, collaborate, and apply knowledge, mirroring the process professionals use to solve challenges in their fields.\n\n### Implementation in the Classroom\n\nTo implement PBL, the focus is on presenting an authentic problem and guiding students through a structured solution-finding process.\n\n* **Present an Authentic Scenario:** Begin with a \"messy\" problem that has no single correct answer. For example, present students with data on local water quality and challenge them to design a community action plan to reduce pollution.\n* **Follow a Structured Cycle:** Guide students through a PBL cycle. A common model includes analyzing the problem, defining learning objectives (what we need to know), conducting independent and group research, synthesizing findings, proposing a solution, and reflecting on the process.\n* **Act as a Facilitator:** The teacher's role shifts from a \"sage on the stage\" to a \"guide on the side.\" Provide resources, ask probing questions to deepen thinking, and offer scaffolding, especially for students new to PBL.\n\n### Using EarthChasers to Support this Strategy\n\nThe *EarthChasers* game can serve as an excellent launchpad for a PBL unit. A game focusing on global food production might reveal a startling fact about food deserts in a particular urban area. This single piece of trivia becomes the hook for a complex problem.\n\nThe teacher can frame the challenge: \"Given what we know about food insecurity from *EarthChasers*, how could we design a sustainable solution to increase access to fresh food in a neighborhood within our own city?\" Students must then research urban agriculture, logistics, economics, and community needs to develop a comprehensive proposal. This process cultivates vital skills in **collaborative problem solving**, turning a simple game fact into a powerful, project-based learning experience.\n\n## 3. Strategy 3: Discovery Learning\n\nDiscovery Learning is a powerful inquiry-based approach where students construct their own understanding by actively exploring concepts through hands-on experiences and experimentation. Instead of receiving information directly from a teacher, learners engage with materials, problems, and environments to uncover principles and solutions on their own. This strategy, heavily influenced by the work of theorists like Jerome Bruner and Jean Piaget, positions the teacher as a facilitator who creates a rich learning landscape rather than a lecturer who dispenses facts.\n\nThe core of this method is the belief that genuine understanding comes from personal discovery. Students are encouraged to manipulate objects, engage in simulations, and conduct experiments to see relationships and patterns for themselves. As one of the most hands-on **strategies for inquiry based learning**, it transforms abstract concepts into tangible experiences, fostering deep conceptual knowledge and a strong sense of ownership over the learning process.\n\n### Implementation in the Classroom\n\nTo implement Discovery Learning, the focus is on creating a prepared environment that invites exploration and provides the necessary tools for students to make connections.\n\n* **Provide a Rich Environment:** For a biology unit on ecosystems, this might mean setting up terrariums or stream tables. For a physics lesson on circuits, it would involve providing batteries, wires, bulbs, and switches with minimal initial instruction.\n* **Use Guiding Questions:** Instead of providing answers, ask open-ended questions to steer exploration. For example, \"What happens when you connect the wires differently?\" or \"What patterns do you notice in the water flow?\"\n* **Allow Time for Exploration:** Discovery takes time. Build unstructured or semi-structured exploration periods into your lesson plans, allowing students to experiment, fail, and try again without the pressure of immediate correctness.\n* **Facilitate a Debrief:** After exploration, guide a whole-class discussion where students share their findings, articulate the principles they discovered, and correct any misconceptions with peer and teacher support.\n\n### Using EarthChasers to Support this Strategy\n\nThe *EarthChasers* trivia game can serve as an excellent catalyst for Discovery Learning. A game round featuring questions about plate tectonics and volcanoes can set the stage for a hands-on discovery activity. A teacher could provide students with maps of earthquake and volcano locations, topographical maps, and continental plates.\n\nWithout giving them the answer, the teacher can pose a challenge: \"Using these maps, can you discover the relationship between these geological features?\" Students would then physically overlay the maps or use digital tools to discover for themselves that volcanoes and earthquakes are concentrated along plate boundaries. This active process of discovery turns a trivia fact into a deeply understood geological principle. For more insights on this hands-on approach, you can explore this post on [interactive learning](https://earthchasers.com/blog/what-is-interactive-learning).\n\n## 4. Project-Based Learning (PBL)\n\nProject-Based Learning (PBL) is an extended inquiry strategy where students engage in a sustained, in-depth investigation of a complex, real-world challenge. Unlike shorter inquiry cycles, PBL involves students working over an extended period, often weeks or even a full semester, to create a tangible product, presentation, or performance as the culmination of their learning. This method emphasizes both content mastery and the development of critical skills like collaboration, communication, and problem-solving.\n\nThe process is anchored by a compelling driving question or problem, such as \"How can we design a sustainable neighborhood for our city?\" Students then embark on a journey of sustained inquiry, research, and creation to answer it. This approach is one of the most comprehensive **strategies for inquiry based learning** because it requires students to manage long-term goals, integrate feedback, and present their work to an authentic audience, mirroring professional, real-world challenges.\n\n### Implementation in the Classroom\n\nSuccessfully implementing PBL requires careful planning to balance student autonomy with clear learning objectives. The collaborative nature of these projects offers a powerful way to integrate various [social learning examples](https://www.medial.com/post/10-actionable-social-learning-examples-for-modern-learners) into your curriculum.\n\n* **Launch with a Compelling Entry Event:** Start the project with an engaging experience, like a guest speaker, a field trip, or a provocative video, to spark curiosity and establish the project's real-world relevance.\n* **Establish Clear Objectives and Rubrics:** From the outset, provide students with clear learning goals and detailed rubrics that assess both the final product and the skills developed throughout the process (e.g., collaboration, critical thinking).\n* **Build in Feedback and Revision:** Structure the project timeline to include regular check-ins, peer feedback sessions, and opportunities for revision. This iterative process is crucial for deep learning and high-quality work.\n* **Connect to an Authentic Audience:** Arrange for students to present their final products to people outside the classroom, such as community members, industry professionals, or other students, to give their work real-world purpose.\n\n### Using EarthChasers to Support this Strategy\n\n*EarthChasers* can serve as an excellent catalyst for a PBL unit. For instance, a game session highlighting global climate patterns and environmental hotspots could introduce a driving question: \"How can our local community contribute to solving a global climate challenge?\"\n\nStudents could use the game's geographical data as a starting point for their initial research, identifying a specific issue like water scarcity or habitat loss. Their project could involve designing a community action plan, creating an educational campaign, or engineering a small-scale solution. The final product might be a presentation to the city council or a documentary film, showcasing a deep, inquiry-driven understanding of geography and environmental science far beyond simple trivia recall.\n\n## 5. Guided Inquiry\n\nGuided Inquiry serves as a crucial bridge between highly structured, teacher-led instruction and completely open, student-driven exploration. In this model, the teacher provides the initial question, topic, and necessary resources, but students determine the procedure and process for reaching a conclusion. This approach scaffolds the learning experience, offering essential support while preserving student agency and critical thinking.\n\nThis strategy is one of the most versatile **strategies for inquiry based learning** because it balances freedom with focus. Teachers guide students toward specific learning objectives by curating materials and providing a framework, preventing the overwhelm that can sometimes accompany pure discovery learning. Popularized by educational researchers like Carol Kuhlthau, this method ensures students develop core research skills within a supportive and purposefully designed environment. For a deeper look at creating these types of supportive educational environments, you can learn more about the principles behind [student-centered learning](https://earthchasers.com/blog/what-is-student-centered-learning).\n\n### Implementation in the Classroom\n\nSuccessfully implementing Guided Inquiry involves creating a structured yet flexible pathway for students to follow. The goal is to provide just enough support to keep them on track without dictating their every move.\n\n* **Utilize the 5E Model:** Structure your lessons using the Engage, Explore, Explain, Elaborate, and Evaluate sequence. This proven framework naturally guides students through the inquiry process, from initial curiosity to demonstrated understanding.\n* **Provide Research Templates:** Offer graphic organizers or digital templates that help students structure their research. These tools can guide them in gathering evidence, analyzing sources, and formulating conclusions without prescribing what those conclusions should be.\n* **Employ Question Progressions:** Start with foundational, lower-order questions to build a knowledge base, then gradually introduce more complex, higher-order thinking questions that require analysis, synthesis, and evaluation. This models the inquiry process and builds student confidence.\n\n### Using EarthChasers to Support this Strategy\n\nThe *EarthChasers* game can serve as the \"Engage\" phase of a Guided Inquiry lesson. A teacher can present a specific, curated set of game questions related to a single topic, such as \"Water Scarcity in North Africa.\"\n\nAfter the game, the teacher poses a broad guiding question: \"What are the most significant factors contributing to water scarcity in North Africa, and what is one innovative solution being implemented?\" Students are then provided with a curated set of resources-articles, data sets from the World Bank, and documentaries. They use these materials to investigate the question, analyze information, and present their findings. This method uses the game's content as a launchpad for a focused, teacher-guided investigation.\n\n## 6. Case Study Inquiry\n\nCase Study Inquiry is a strategy that immerses students in the detailed analysis of real or realistic scenarios to explore complex concepts and develop problem-solving skills. Instead of learning abstract theories, students investigate a specific \"case,\" such as a historical event, a business dilemma, or a scientific phenomenon. They dissect the situation, identify key issues, analyze data, and propose solutions or conclusions.\n\nThis method transforms learners into investigators, requiring them to apply theoretical knowledge to a tangible context. The process starts with a carefully selected case that embodies the core principles of a topic. Students then work through the case, often collaboratively, to understand its nuances and implications. This is one of the most effective **strategies for inquiry based learning** because it bridges the gap between classroom knowledge and real-world application, fostering deep analytical and critical thinking skills.\n\n### Implementation in the Classroom\n\nTo implement this strategy effectively, the focus should be on selecting compelling cases and structuring the analytical process to guide student discovery.\n\n* **Select Rich Cases:** Choose cases that are complex, contain a central dilemma or tension, and offer multiple perspectives. A case about a real-world environmental pollution incident, for instance, should include scientific data, community testimonials, and corporate statements.\n* **Provide a Framework:** Give students a structured guide for their analysis. This could include a set of guiding questions, a graphic organizer for identifying stakeholders and their motives, or a problem-solving model to follow.\n* **Facilitate Structured Discussion:** Use protocols like a \"Socratic Seminar\" or \"Chalk Talk\" to ensure discussions are productive and inclusive. The goal is to encourage students to build on each other's insights, challenge assumptions, and synthesize diverse viewpoints to form a comprehensive understanding.\n\n### Using EarthChasers to Support this Strategy\n\nThe *EarthChasers* game can serve as an excellent entry point for a Case Study Inquiry. A game focused on global economies might feature a trivia card about the 2008 financial crisis in Iceland. This single fact can become the anchor for an in-depth case study.\n\nA teacher could present the class with the case: \"How did a small island nation like Iceland become a global financial hub and then face a catastrophic collapse?\" Students would then investigate the economic policies, banking practices, and global factors involved. They could analyze data on Iceland’s GDP, read articles about its \"Pots and Pans Revolution,\" and debate the ethical decisions made. The initial *EarthChasers* fact thus blossoms into a rich, multi-faceted inquiry into economics, politics, and social geography.\n\n## 7. Scientific Inquiry / Experimental Inquiry\n\nScientific Inquiry, also known as Experimental Inquiry, is a systematic strategy where students directly engage in the authentic practices of science. It moves beyond learning scientific facts to understanding the scientific process itself. Students learn to develop testable questions, design and conduct controlled experiments, meticulously collect data, analyze their results, and draw evidence-based conclusions that they can defend.\n\nThis approach immerses students in the mindset of a scientist, emphasizing the critical importance of empirical evidence, reproducibility, and peer review. It’s one of the most hands-on **strategies for inquiry based learning**, teaching not just content but also the methodical thinking and problem-solving skills inherent to scientific discovery. This process is fundamental to how we build reliable knowledge about the natural world.\n\n### Implementation in the Classroom\n\nTo successfully implement this strategy, the focus is on creating a safe and structured environment for experimentation where students learn from all outcomes, not just the expected ones.\n\n* **Explicitly Teach Experimental Design:** Dedicate time to teaching core concepts like independent, dependent, and controlled variables. Guide students in formulating a clear, testable hypothesis.\n* **Embrace 'Failed' Experiments:** Frame unexpected results or experimental errors not as failures but as valuable learning opportunities. This encourages resilience and teaches students the iterative nature of scientific investigation.\n* **Analyze and Conclude with Evidence:** Guide students to use their collected data to support their conclusions. For those engaging in Scientific / Experimental Inquiry, understanding foundational statistical methods like [hypothesis testing in statistics](https://feen.ai/blog/what-is-hypothesis-testing-in-statistics) is often crucial for data analysis and drawing valid conclusions.\n* **Promote Peer Review and Presentation:** Have students present their findings to their peers, who can ask questions and critique the methodology. This mirrors the real-world scientific community and reinforces communication skills.\n\n### Using EarthChasers to Support this Strategy\n\nThe *EarthChasers* trivia game can serve as a powerful catalyst for Scientific Inquiry, particularly in subjects like Earth science and environmental studies.\n\nEmbedded content\n\nFor instance, a game question about the effect of volcanic eruptions on global temperatures could spark a classroom investigation. Students could then be challenged to design a small-scale experiment modeling the \"volcanic winter\" effect. They might formulate a hypothesis like: \"Adding fine ash particles to a sealed, light-exposed container will cause its internal temperature to drop compared to a control container.\" This simple experiment allows them to test a concept from the game, collect data, and draw conclusions, directly applying the principles of Scientific Inquiry.\n\n## 8. Socratic Inquiry / Socratic Method\n\nSocratic Inquiry, also known as the Socratic Method, is a disciplined form of dialogue centered on asking and answering strategic questions. Rather than providing direct answers, the teacher acts as a facilitator, guiding students through a series of probing questions that help them examine their own beliefs, challenge assumptions, and arrive at a more profound understanding on their own. This ancient pedagogical approach transforms learning from a passive reception of information into an active process of critical examination and self-discovery.\n\nThe core of this method is the belief that knowledge is discovered, not transmitted. A teacher initiates a discussion with a thoughtful, open-ended question. As students respond, the teacher asks follow-up questions that require them to clarify their statements, consider counterexamples, and explore the logical implications of their thoughts. This makes Socratic Inquiry one of the most powerful **strategies for inquiry based learning** for developing reasoning skills and surfacing deep-seated misconceptions.\n\n### Implementation in the Classroom\n\nTo effectively use the Socratic Method, the focus must be on creating a safe, collaborative environment where students feel comfortable exploring and defending their ideas.\n\n* **Plan Your Questioning Arc:** Before a discussion, map out a logical sequence of questions. Start with broad, foundational questions and prepare follow-up probes that will push students to delve deeper into the topic, such as \"Why do you believe that is true?\" or \"What would be an example of that?\"\n* **Embrace Strategic Silence:** After asking a question, allow for ample \"think time.\" Silence can feel uncomfortable, but it is a crucial tool that gives students the mental space needed to formulate thoughtful, well-reasoned responses instead of rushed, superficial ones.\n* **Focus on the Process, Not the Answer:** The goal is not for students to arrive at a single \"correct\" answer dictated by the teacher. Instead, the objective is to model and practice the process of critical thinking, logical reasoning, and evidence-based argumentation.\n\n### Using EarthChasers to Support this Strategy\n\nThe *EarthChasers* trivia game provides a perfect launchpad for a Socratic seminar. A game focused on global economies might present a fact about the GDP of a particular country, which can serve as the initial prompt for a deeper inquiry.\n\nFor instance, after a question about Switzerland's high GDP, a teacher could begin a Socratic discussion by asking, \"What makes a country 'wealthy'?\" Student answers might focus on money or resources. The teacher could then follow up with questions like, \"Can a country be wealthy in resources but have a poor population? Why?\" and \"Does a high GDP always mean a high quality of life for all citizens? What evidence supports your view?\" This line of questioning guides students to deconstruct complex concepts like wealth and economic indicators, moving them from a simple fact to a nuanced understanding.\n\n## 9. Community-Based Inquiry and Service Learning\n\nCommunity-Based Inquiry and Service Learning grounds the learning process in real-world local issues, transforming students into active citizens. This approach moves beyond the classroom walls, empowering students to investigate authentic community challenges and then take meaningful action to address them. The inquiry is not just academic; it is driven by a genuine need and culminates in service that benefits the community.\n\nThis strategy merges academic standards with civic responsibility. The process begins with identifying a genuine community need, such as food insecurity, environmental pollution, or lack of accessible public spaces. Students then conduct in-depth research, collaborate with community partners, and design and implement a service project to address the identified issue. This is one of the most impactful **strategies for inquiry based learning** because it makes learning relevant and demonstrates to students their own agency in creating positive change.\n\n### Implementation in the Classroom\n\nTo implement this strategy, the focus is on building authentic relationships and ensuring the project is mutually beneficial for both students and the community.\n\n* **Forge Genuine Partnerships:** Reach out to local non-profits, government agencies, or community leaders. Build relationships based on respect and a shared goal, ensuring the community's voice is central to the project.\n* **Balance Action and Reflection:** The \"service\" is just one component. Dedicate significant time to the inquiry phase (researching root causes) and the reflection phase (analyzing the impact and systemic issues) to ensure deep learning occurs.\n* **Connect to Curriculum:** Explicitly map the project's activities and learning outcomes to specific academic standards in social studies, science, language arts, and other subjects. This ensures the project has clear academic rigor.\n\n### Using EarthChasers to Support this Strategy\n\nThe *EarthChasers* trivia game can serve as an excellent catalyst for identifying local issues with global parallels. A game round focusing on global food production or water scarcity could spark an inquiry into similar challenges within the students' own community.\n\nFor instance, a question about agricultural practices in the Great Plains might lead students to ask, \"Where does our own community's food come from?\" This question could launch a community-based inquiry into local food deserts or the challenges faced by local farmers. Students could then partner with a food bank to develop a community garden, directly applying their learning. Their final project could even involve creating a new *EarthChasers* \"Community Changemakers\" deck focused on local solutions to global problems.\n\n## Comparison of 9 Inquiry-Based Learning Strategies\n\n| Title | Implementation Complexity (🔄) | Resource Requirements (⚡) | Expected Outcomes (⭐ / 📊) | Ideal Use Cases (📊) | Key Advantages (⭐) | Tip (💡) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Question-Based Inquiry Learning | Moderate — needs question scaffolding and facilitation | Low–Moderate — research materials and time | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ — deeper understanding, critical thinking, metacognition | Introductory inquiries, classroom units, formative exploration | Encourages curiosity and student ownership of learning | Start with structured question stems and document the inquiry |\n| Problem-Based Learning (PBL) | High — requires curriculum redesign and teacher training | High — complex problems, time, possible expert involvement | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ — higher-order thinking, collaboration, real-world problem solving | Professional programs, interdisciplinary real-world challenges | Strong real-world relevance and teamwork development | Use a clear PBL cycle and provide scaffolding for learners |\n| Discovery Learning | Moderate–High — teacher prepares open environments and monitors | Moderate–High — varied materials and flexible spaces | ⭐⭐⭐ — deep, experiential learning but risk of misconceptions | Early childhood, exploratory labs, concept discovery | Promotes independence, intrinsic motivation, hands-on learning | Provide rich materials, guide with questions, debrief discoveries |\n| Project-Based Learning (PBL) | High — long-term planning, coordination, assessment design | High — extended time, materials, audience connections | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ — 21st-century skills, sustained mastery, portfolios | Capstone projects, interdisciplinary units, community projects | Produces tangible outcomes and sustained student engagement | Launch with a driving question and use rubrics for process/product |\n| Guided Inquiry | Moderate — structured frameworks and responsive teaching required | Moderate — templates, datasets, scaffolds | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ — efficient learning with maintained inquiry and standards alignment | Standards-aligned units, mixed-ability classrooms, skill building | Balances structure and student agency;

(2024, May 21). Socratic Teaching Techniques for Effective Learning. Retrieved from www.structural-learning.com/post/socratic-teaching-techniques-for-effective-learning\n\n## What is the Socratic Process?\n\nThe Socratic Process transforms your classroom into a space for productive discussion. This active learning technique uses [well-designed questions](https://www.structural-learning.com/post/questioning-in-teaching) to help students examine their thinking and build understanding through dialogue. You ask, students respond, and together you explore ideas that sit beneath surface-level knowledge.\n\nThis approach works across wide ranges of subjects and age groups. Students make claims with examples, test their reasoning, and experience productive discomfort as they question what they thought they knew. The method thrives on collaborative inquiry rather than [direct instruction](https://www.structural-learning.com/post/direct-instruction-a-teachers-guide).\n\nThree key elements make the Socratic Process effective in your classroom:\n\n* **Structured dialogue formats** – Socratic seminars and Socratic Circles give students frameworks for meaningful discussion. You set up the format, students take ownership of the conversation, and learning happens through peer interaction.\n* **Strategic questioning** – Your questions guide without telling. You probe assumptions, ask for evidence, and encourage students to consider alternative viewpoints. This systematic approach builds [critical thinking skills](https://www.structural-learning.com/post/what-is-critical-thinking) that transfer beyond your classroom.\n* **Student-centered exploration** – Your role shifts from knowledge deliverer to dialogue facilitator. Students discover answers through their own reasoning, which creates deeper understanding than memorizing facts.\n\nThe technique originated with the [Greek philosopher](https://www.structural-learning.com/post/ancient-greek-philosophy) Socrates, who claimed to know nothing but used questioning to expose gaps in others' knowledge. Teachers today apply this method to help students think independently and critically about complex ideas.\n\nLaw schools rely heavily on Socratic questioning to sharpen analytical skills, but the method works equally well in primary schools, secondary classrooms, and any setting where you want students to think rather than simply absorb. The process requires patience and practice, yet the payoff comes when students begin asking their own probing questions and taking intellectual risks.\n\n‍\n\n‍\n\n### Definition and overview\n\nIn essence, the Socratic method is a pedagogical approach that encourages students to engage in critical thinking and to discover answers by themselves through a series of methodical and reflective questions. Socratic questioning serves as a powerful tool to dissect complex ideas, delve into assumptions, and break down conceptual frameworks.\n\nIn the classroom, this technique prompts students to question their own knowledge and convictions, consequently fostering intellectual humility and the ability to scrutinize and refine their understanding. Moreover, the role of the teacher in this methodology shifts from being the conveyor of knowledge to a facilitator of dialogue, championing the art of inquiry over simply delivering content.\n\nThe process capitalizes on active learning, where students' insights unfold as they articulate responses to [carefully crafted questions](https://www.structural-learning.com/post/questioning-in-teaching). Law schools, in particular, often employ this method to sharpen a law student's ability to analyze and argue effectively, evidencing the process’s versatility across different fields of study.\n\n‍\n\n### Historical background\n\nThe roots of the Socratic Process are firmly planted in the rich soil of ancient Greece, introduced by the philosopher Socrates as a way to challenge and expand the horizons of human understanding. Socrates himself claimed to know nothing, but through his skilled line of inquiry, he prompted those around him to reconsider their beliefs and the extent of their knowledge.\n\nTeachers today bring this historical legacy into their classrooms by adopting Socrates's approach to draw out insights from students through a collaborative and [open-ended dialogue](https://www.structural-learning.com/post/the-importance-of-oracy-in-language-development). The method resists the notion of spoon-feeding facts; instead, it endeavors to bring forth an individual's innate wisdom and to channel it into a vigor for life-long learning.\n\nThis approach has stood the test of time for its effectiveness in promoting critical thinking and for empowering students to take ownership of their intellectual growth.\n\n‍\n\n## Influences of Bertrand Russell on Socratic Teaching\n\nThe philosophical principles of Bertrand Russell have played a pivotal role in shaping contemporary understanding and applications of the Socratic teaching method. Russell's philosophy, centered on the importance of questioning assumptions and underlying beliefs, complements the fundamental objective of the Socratic method, which is to challenge presuppositions and foster critical thinking.\n\nRussell's contributions to the Socratic teaching method emanate from his persistent emphasis on critical thinking and inquiry-based learning. He championed the view that education should not merely be about the absorption of facts, but rather, a journey of exploration led by probing questions that challenge existing assumptions, thus stimulating rich intellectual dialogue.\n\nThrough his own teaching and writing, Russell underscored the utility of employing a discipline of questioning, much like Socratic questioning, to uncover latent presuppositions and encourage a deeper engagement with ideas. His influence has extended to educators who use the Socratic method, resonating with his philosophy that places cooperation and mutual understanding at the core of intellectual discourse.\n\n‍\n\n‍\n\n### Examination of the impact of Russell's philosophy on education\n\nShifting focus to the more broad-reaching impact of Russell's philosophy on education, it becomes evident that his endorsement of the Socratic method aligns seamlessly with the aim of empowering students to become [independent thinkers](https://www.structural-learning.com/post/independent-learning-a-teachers-guide).\n\nIn the classroom setting, Socratic discussions informed by Russell’s philosophies guide students to understand and grapple with complex ideas through carefully structured questions and collaborative observations. This method has been instrumental in educational institutions like Great Hearts, where literature and humane letters classes often engage with philosophical discourse and great texts using the Socratic approach.\n\nSuch [dialogue-driven](https://www.structural-learning.com/post/the-power-of-dialogic-reading) classes exemplify how the Socratic method remains essential for unearthing the deeper truths within texts and concepts while mitigating the risk of bias and misconceptions. Ultimately, the marriage of Russell's philosophy with the Socratic method promotes a [culture of learning](https://www.structural-learning.com/post/habits-of-mind) through rigorous questioning, encouraging students to think more deeply and embark on their own pathways of discovery, extending beyond philosophy into a plethora of scholastic domains.\n\n## The Importance of Critical Thinking Skills\n\nDeveloping critical thinking skills is a cornerstone of educational progress and personal development. Through the strategic application of the Socratic method, students are encouraged to dive deeply into their belief systems, thoroughly examining the assumptions they hold about various topics. The process goes beyond mere surface learning or [rote memorization](https://www.structural-learning.com/post/rote-learning); it involves engaging in a dynamic exploration of ideas that requires the learner to question, evaluate, and synthesize information.\n\nThis active participation is essential for effective learning, as research with undergraduate business students has demonstrated the capacity of the Socratic approach to significantly enhance critical thinking abilities. As students become adept in this technique, they not only improve their analytical skills but also enhance their [reading comprehension](https://www.structural-learning.com/post/theories-of-reading). They learn to consider multiple viewpoints and grasp the complexity of issues at hand.\n\nEssential too is the role of critical thinking in maintaining student engagement. The Socratic method propels continuous participation and lively dialogue, keeping the learning environment vibrant. Students are not passive recipients of knowledge; instead, they are architects of their learning experiences, drawing conclusions from their [self-driven inquiry](https://www.structural-learning.com/post/self-directed-learning-a-school-guide). As they navigate through the questioning process, they cultivate an independent mindset, becoming better prepared for decision-making in their academic and personal lives.\n\n‍\n\n‍\n\n### Definition and explanation of critical thinking\n\nCritical thinking is intimately tied to the art of Socratic questioning. It involves deep, [reflective thinking](https://www.structural-learning.com/post/reflective-practice) with the intent to evaluate and determine beliefs or actions about a particular subject. It encompasses [Socrates' philosophy](https://www.structural-learning.com/post/ancient-greek-philosophy) of examining individual knowledge, acknowledging one's limits, and striving to pinpoint gaps in understanding. Critical thinking equips individuals with the rational tools needed to oversee, critique, and potentially transform their thinking and behaviors.\n\nJohn Dewey, an influential figure in education reform, defined this process as \"reflective inquiry,\" capturing the essence of deliberation at the heart of critical thinking. When fused with Socratic questioning, critical thinking seeks to delve deeper, arouse curiosity, and scrutinize the veracity or feasibility of one's ideas. It is a pathway that leads to meaning and truth, providing the toolkit necessary for reassessing and realigning one's thoughts and decisions.\n\n### Benefits of developing critical thinking skills\n\nBy harnessing the power of the Socratic method, students [embark on an exploration](https://www.structural-learning.com/post/exploratory-talk) of their thought processes, beliefs, and assumptions, fostering a robust set of critical thinking skills. This exploration is not just theoretical; empirical studies support that such an approach enhances students' critical thinking, particularly noticeable in business students' improved reading comprehension. This active engagement with the material enables learners to discern how their inner thoughts and convictions affect their preconceptions.\n\nThe application of the Socratic method in educational settings transforms the classroom into a dynamic, interactive forum for learning. In contrast to traditional didactic instruction, this method stimulates thought, inviting students to fully engage with the subject matter. Students become contributors, not just observers, sharing their insights and learning from the experiences and perspectives of their peers. Therein lies the dual benefit: fostering their intellectual growth while enjoying a richer, more vital education experience.\n\n‍\n\n‍\n\n‍\n\n## The Role of Open-Ended Questions in Socratic Teaching\n\nOpen-ended questions serve as the backbone of the Socratic method, a teaching technique that is celebrated for its ability to foster deep, critical thinking. Unlike yes-or-no inquiries, open-ended questions demand more than mere facts; they require students to expand on their thoughts, weave connections, and articulate their reasoning.\n\nBy employing such questions, educators can keep the class centered on the topic while simultaneously allowing for a rich exploration of the subject matter. As discussions unfold, these questions prove instrumental in maintaining focus, especially when arguments begin to veer off into ambiguity. For example, a leader in a Socratic dialogue might ask, \"What evidence can you provide to support your position?\" prompting students to analyze their arguments critically.\n\nThe beauty of open-ended questions in the Socratic context is that they can gently nudge quieter participants into the discussion, ensuring a diversity of perspectives. Moreover, when students grapple with these types of questions, they move beyond surface-level thinking to distinguish between systematic and [fragmented thought processes](https://www.structural-learning.com/post/cognitive-distortions). This not only transforms the classroom into a hub of active, independent learning but also prepares students for real-world scenarios where such analytical skills are invaluable.\n\n### Definition and examples of open-ended questions\n\nIn the landscape of Socratic dialogues, open-ended questions are those that cannot be answered with a simple 'yes' or 'no'. They are carefully crafted to prompt [deeper inquiry and reflection](https://www.structural-learning.com/post/a-teachers-guide-to-inquiry-based-learning). For instance, questions like \"What is the nature of justice?\" or \"How does this character's journey reflect the author's message?\" are classic examples that invite students to explore underlying themes and engage in comprehensive dialogue.\n\nIn [coaching contexts](https://www.structural-learning.com/post/coaching-conversations), open-ended questions such as \"What do you think are your main strengths in this situation?\" or \"How might you approach this challenge differently?\" play a crucial role. They encourage clients to reflect on their experiences, offering insights that may not surface through close-ended questions. Such questions are not passive; they actively engage the respondent in the process of self-discovery and problem-solving, making them a cornerstone of both educational and [developmental environments.](https://www.structural-learning.com/post/child-development-theories)\n\n‍\n\n‍\n\n### Benefits of using open-ended questions in teaching\n\nIncorporating open-ended questions into teaching practice reaps numerous benefits. These questions compel students to delve into intellectual self-examination, asking them to articulate their thought processes, reflect on their learning, and confront the complexity of various viewpoints. As students wrestle with these inquiries, they begin to [generate new knowledge](https://www.structural-learning.com/post/generative-learning-a-teachers-guide), and educators can observe a tangible expansion in their perspectives.\n\nThis approach inherently promotes a student-centered learning environment, as it insists upon the learner's active participation in the [construction of knowledge](https://www.structural-learning.com/post/embracing-the-learning-theory-constructivism). When educators use this technique, they are not merely dispensing information; they are facilitating a journey of understanding that teaches students how to think, not just what to think. The systematic thinking that is encouraged by Socratic questioning enables individuals to not just memorize but comprehend and critique the foundations of their knowledge and beliefs.\n\n## Incorporating Follow-Up Questions for Deeper Learning\n\nThis dynamic teaching approach is based on the belief that [critical reasoning](https://www.structural-learning.com/post/inductive-reasoning-versus-deductive-reasoning) and questioning are the engines of enlightenment. The Socratic method not only uncovers contradictions within a student's previously held beliefs but also promotes a deeper comprehension of nuanced concepts. A testament to the power of wonder and curiosity, as exemplified in Plato's \"Meno,\" Socratic dialogue acts as a catalyst for self-directed learning—drawing forth the latent [knowledge within students](https://www.structural-learning.com/post/epistemology), much like Socrates' metaphor of midwifery described in \"Theaetetus.\"\n\nThe Socratic method of questioning is a disciplined, conversational technique that uncovers deeply held beliefs and encourages reflective thought. By incorporating follow-up questions, this method can push the boundaries of surface-level understanding and lead learners into a more profound exploration of the subject matter at hand. Follow-up questions serve as a bridge, connecting initial responses with the deeper rivers of reasoning that often remain unexplored. These tools are critical in a Socratic setting, where the goal is not to lead to quick, definitive answers but to journey through the nuances of thought and logic.\n\nSocratic seminars, underpinned by open-ended questions, kickstart this journey. It's not just the starting question that matters; it's the thoughtful, carefully crafted follow-up questions that drive the dialogue forward. These secondary inquiries are vital when discussions hit points of confusion or when arguments become muddled, helping to clarify and refine both the question and the answer. The power of this method lies in the way it [challenges learners](https://www.structural-learning.com/post/stretch-and-challenge-a-teachers-guide) to move beyond their initial reactions and grapple with underlying implications, offering a more nuanced view of the topic.\n\n‍\n\n### Strategies for using follow-up questions effectively\n\nEmploying follow-up questions with efficacy requires strategy. Educators can use these queries to expose the strengths and vulnerabilities of a student's argument, introducing alternative scenarios or perspectives.\n\n**1. Expose Strengths and Vulnerabilities:**\n\nUse follow-up questions to reveal the strengths and weaknesses in a student's argument. Introduce alternative scenarios or perspectives to challenge their thinking.\n\n**2. Unearth Complexity:**\n\nEmploy follow-up questions to delve deeper into seemingly straightforward positions. Encourage richer discussions by exploring the underlying complexities.\n\n**3. Cultivate a Culture of Deep Questioning:**\n\nRegularly pose follow-up questions to promote an environment where deep questioning is the norm. Teach students how to construct and ask their own follow-up questions.\n\n**4. Provide Practical Exercises:**\n\nOffer exercises that practice formulating and asking follow-up questions. Empower students to become inquisitors in their learning journey.\n\n**5. Encourage Critical Scrutiny:**\n\nGuide students to critically examine their knowledge. Help them [differentiate](https://www.structural-learning.com/post/differentiation-strategies-a-teachers-guide) between what they know and what they assume.\n\n**6. Foster Intellectual Humility:**\n\nPromote intellectual humility and a willingness to learn through critical scrutiny. Encourage students to recognize the [limits of their knowledge](https://www.structural-learning.com/post/epistemology).\n\n**7. Back Assertions with Rationale:**\n\nTeach students to support their assertions with well-reasoned explanations. Discourage mere repetition by emphasizing rational responses.\n\n**8. Guide Conversations with Open-Ended Questions:**\n\nUse follow-up questions that cannot be answered with a simple yes or no. Shape learning experiences to promote engagement and critical thinking.\n\n**9. Champion Deeper Knowledge Exploration:**\n\nFacilitate a [deeper dive](https://www.structural-learning.com/post/deeper-learning) into the realms of knowledge through follow-up questioning. Foster an engaging and thought-provoking classroom environment.\n\n‍\n\n‍\n\n## Teaching Complex Ideas Through Socratic Discussion\n\nThe beauty of teaching through the Socratic method is its emphasis on cultivating a deeper understanding through dialogue. Unlike traditional didactic instruction, complex ideas in subjects like literature, philosophy, and even mathematics are not simply [presented for memorization](https://www.structural-learning.com/post/8-effective-memorization-techniques) but are unraveled collaboratively between teacher and students.\n\nInstructors employing the Socratic method act not as lecturers but as guides, facilitating a classroom environment where questioning is the cornerstone of learning. They model the art of probing deeply through open-ended questions, fostering an atmosphere where students feel secure in voicing their thoughts and counterarguments. Socratic discussions are structured so that knowledge is not handed down but constructed within the minds of the students, helping them to build connections and reinforce understanding.\n\nThis method's strength is its ability to differentiate between systematic and fragmented thinking, pushing individuals towards coherence in their reasoning. As each question leads to further inquiry and critical thinking, students actively engage in their [learning journey](https://www.structural-learning.com/post/learner-journey), reaching beyond the basics to develop independent, analytical, and creative thought processes that will serve them well in any academic or [real-world challenge.](https://www.structural-learning.com/post/expeditionary-learning)\n\n## Understanding Different Types of Questions in Socratic Teaching\n\nThe Socratic Process is inherently centered around engaging students with different types of questions designed to deepen understanding and encourage keen analysis. It's a method that moves beyond seeking mere recall of information and instead invites learners to think critically about the material presented.\n\nIt challenges students to clarify their thoughts, examine the origins and motivations of their beliefs, and confront their [potential biases](https://www.structural-learning.com/post/cognitive-biases) and assumptions. Let’s delve into the nuances of this approach, understand the diversity of questions utilized, and appreciate how this methodology enhances learning experiences.\n\n‍\n\n### Examples and explanations of each type of question\n\nLet's consider examples and purposes of these question types within the Socratic Process:\n\n* **Clarifying Questions** might include, “What do you mean when you say…” or “Can you explain further…”. They serve to ensure everyone has a shared understanding of terminology and concepts.\n* **Assumption Questions** delve deeper with, “What are we assuming here?” or “Why do you think this assumption holds true?” These questions push students to question the base of their arguments.\n* **Rationale and Evidence Questions** ask for the foundations of the argument, such as “What is the reason for this claim?” or “What evidence do we have to support this view?”. They help students to ground their discussions in facts and reason.\n* **Viewpoints and Perspectives Questions** introduce broader thinking with queries like, “What might someone who disagrees say?” or “How might this issue be viewed from another perspective?”, thereby opening the floor to a multiplicity of views.\n* **Implications and Consequences Questions** encourage forward-thinking, asking, “What could be the consequences of this action?” or “What are the implications if this is true?”. Such questions help students to consider the broader ramifications of ideas.\n* **Questions about Questions** turn the focus back onto the inquiry itself: “Why do you think this question is important?” or “How does this question help us understand the problem better?”. This meta-analysis sharpens critical thinking further.\n\nThrough these dynamic and thought-provoking questions, the Socratic Process weaves a fabric of intellectual discovery that reaches far beyond the walls of the classroom, preparing students for the complex reasoning and analysis required in modern society.\n\n‍\n\n## 9 Ideas for Bringing Socratic Methods to your Classroom\n\nBringing the venerable Socratic method into the classroom isn't just for law students; it's a powerful way to enhance critical thinking and engagement for learners across disciplines. With its foundation in a series of questions, this method can unravel complex ideas and stimulate active learning. Here are 9 ideas to integrate the Socratic process into your teaching:\n\n1. **Begin with Open-Ended Questions**: Initiate discussions with queries that lack a simple yes or no answer to encourage expansive thinking.\n2. **Encourage Follow-Up Questions**: After an initial response, ask students to delve deeper with additional queries.\n3. **Use Socratic Dialogues**: Engage in argumentative dialogue where positions must be justified, fostering a deeper understanding of the subject matter.\n4. **Model Questioning Techniques**: Demonstrate how to ask effective, analytical questions to guide students in their own questioning abilities.\n5. **Socratic Circles**: Organize students into inner and outer circles to discuss and then reflect on the dialogue, promoting listening and critical analysis.\n6. **Analyze Beliefs**: Have students scrutinize their own beliefs and assumptions, encouraging intellectual humility.\n7. **Employ Types of Questions**: Use clarifying, probing, and speculative questions to examine ideas from various angles.\n8. **Socratic Discussions**: Facilitate a dialogue between individuals to explore different viewpoints within a controlled setting.\n9. **Incorporate into Active Learning**: Align the Socratic method with active learning experiences, prompting students to become participants rather than passive listeners.\n\nIntegrating these approaches can transform learning experiences, turning the classroom into a dynamic space for intellectual discovery and growth.\n\n‍\n\n‍\n\n## Using the Toolkit for Socratic Learning\n\nIntegrating [structural learning tools](https://www.structural-learning.com) to foster Socratic thinking in the classroom can significantly enhance students' metacognition, reasoning, and depth of knowledge. Here are seven effective strategies using various structural learning tools:\n\n1. **Graphic Organisers**: Use Venn diagrams and fishbone diagrams to help students compare and contrast different viewpoints during Socratic questioning. These tools enable students to [visually organise](https://www.structural-learning.com/post/visual-learning) their thoughts, which enhances reasoning and helps them explore different beliefs​​​​.\n2. **Thinking Framework**: Implement the [Thinking Framework](https://www.structural-learning.com/thinking-framework) to develop structured dialogue. Encourage students to use the framework’s question stems and sentence starters, promoting [continuous provision](https://www.structural-learning.com/post/continuous-provision-a-teachers-guide) and deeper dialogue between teachers and students. This approach ensures students engage in [higher-order thinking](https://www.structural-learning.com/post/higher-order-thinking-skills) and reasoning​​​​.\n3. [**Writer's Block**](https://www.structural-learning.com/block): Use Writer’s Block to scaffold students' thinking processes. This method helps students organise their thoughts into coherent structures, making it easier to communicate their reasoning during Socratic circles. It also [supports differentiation](https://www.structural-learning.com/post/differentiation-strategies-a-teachers-guide) by allowing students to work at their own pace and level​​​​.\n4. **Oracy Toolkit**: Leverage the talking toolkit to facilitate Socratic questioning. Encourage students to take on different roles within discussions, fostering a deeper understanding through role-play and perspective-taking. This method aligns with [Webb's Depth of Knowledge](https://www.structural-learning.com/post/webbs-depth-of-knowledge) by challenging students to justify their answers to questions and engage in metacognitive reflection​​.\n5. **Mental Modelling**: Use mental modelling to help students build and articulate their understanding. By physically manipulating blocks to represent their ideas, students can make their thinking visible and engage in meaningful dialogue about the connections between different concepts. This hands-on method supports the method of teaching that emphasises building [deep conceptual understanding​​.](https://www.structural-learning.com/post/concept-based-learning)\n6. **Curriculum Sequencing**: Incorporate curriculum sequencing to ensure a logical progression of knowledge. This structured approach helps students "

The use case applied in this research leverages land cover data and employs dynamic questioning, where users respond based on their actual experiences, rather than a mixture of experiences and perceptions, as is common in survey questionnaires. [...] In this paper, we have proposed a novel approach to the user experience for mobility-driven applications by enabling route selection based on individualized factors such as safety, environmental quality, and scenery. With the successful implementation of our prototype, we can now provide an adaptable, context-aware questionnaire that captures users’ experiences in real-time. The resulting datasets gathered from user feedback through this path segmentation and customized questioning approach [...] to present an adaptive questionnaire tailored to the characteristics of that land cover type.\nRaw Content: Context-Aware QoE for Mobility-Driven Applications Through Dynamic Surveys\n\n===============\n\n Next Article in Journal\n\n[Cybersecurity as a Contributor Toward Resilient Internet of Things (IoT) Infrastructure and Sustainable Economic Growth](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/15/12/798)\n\n Previous Article in Journal\n\n[Research on the Application of Topic Models Based on Geological Disaster Information Mining](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/15/12/795)\n\nJournals\n--------\n\n[Active Journals](https://www.mdpi.com/about/journals)[Find a Journal](https://www.mdpi.com/about/journalfinder)[Journal Proposal](https://www.mdpi.com/about/journals/proposal)[Proceedings Series](https://www.mdpi.com/about/proceedings)\n\n[Topics ------](https://www.mdpi.com/topics)\n\nInformation\n-----------\n\n[For Authors](https://www.mdpi.com/authors)[For Reviewers](https://www.mdpi.com/reviewers)[For Editors](https://www.mdpi.com/editors)[For Librarians](https://www.mdpi.com/librarians)[For Publishers](https://www.mdpi.com/publishing_services)[For Societies](https://www.mdpi.com/societies)[For Conference Organizers](https://www.mdpi.com/conference_organizers)\n\n[Open Access Policy](https://www.mdpi.com/openaccess)[Institutional Open Access Program](https://www.mdpi.com/ioap)[Special Issues Guidelines](https://www.mdpi.com/special_issues_guidelines)[Editorial Process](https://www.mdpi.com/editorial_process)[Research and Publication Ethics](https://www.mdpi.com/ethics)[Article Processing Charges](https://www.mdpi.com/apc)[Awards](https://www.mdpi.com/awards)[Testimonials](https://www.mdpi.com/testimonials)\n\n[Author Services ---------------](https://www.mdpi.com/authors/english)\n\nInitiatives\n-----------\n\n[Sciforum](https://sciforum.net/)[MDPI Books](https://www.mdpi.com/books)[Preprints.org](https://www.preprints.org/)[Scilit](https://www.scilit.com/)[SciProfiles](https://sciprofiles.com/)[Encyclopedia](https://encyclopedia.pub/)[JAMS](https://jams.pub/)[Proceedings Series](https://www.mdpi.com/about/proceedings)\n\nAbout\n-----\n\n[Overview](https://www.mdpi.com/about)[Contact](https://www.mdpi.com/about/contact)[Careers](https://careers.mdpi.com/)[News](https://www.mdpi.com/about/announcements)[Press](https://www.mdpi.com/about/press)[Blog](http://blog.mdpi.com/)\n\n[Sign In / Sign Up](https://www.mdpi.com/user/login)\n\nNotice\n------\n\n You can make submissions to other journals [here](https://susy.mdpi.com/user/manuscripts/upload). \n\n[_clear_](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/15/12/797)\n\nNotice\n------\n\nYou are accessing a machine-readable page.

While these innovations offer significant benefits, they also pose challenges due to the many factors influencing the user’s quality of experience. Traditional methods of assessing user experiences, such as offline surveys and static questionnaires, often fail to capture the dynamic nature of outdoor activities. This research proposes a novel Quality of Experience (QoE) methodology for mobile applications to enhance the assessment of user experiences in cycling. Focusing on a use case in Blekinge, Sweden, where residents were encouraged to adopt cycling for daily transportation, we extracted land cover data and developed a server-side workflow for bicycle path segmentation. By incorporating dynamic surveys that adapt to users’ real-time experiences, we aim to generate a more accurate and context-aware dataset. This study makes several key contributions: First, it presents a scalable method for bicycle path segmentation; second, it demonstrates the utility and benefits of land cover data extraction; and finally, it evaluates the effectiveness of QoE influence factors through user surveys based on real-world cyclist feedback. This approach is expected to enhance the planning and development of cycling infrastructure by providing urban planners and stakeholders with valuable user insights using adaptable surveys based on route segmentation.\n\nKeywords: \n\n[QoE in outdoor sports](https://www.mdpi.com/search?q=QoE+in+outdoor+sports); [dynamic QoE](https://www.mdpi.com/search?q=dynamic+QoE); [bicycle path segmentation](https://www.mdpi.com/search?q=bicycle+path+segmentation); [landcover in outdoor sports](https://www.mdpi.com/search?q=landcover+in+outdoor+sports); [human IFs and bicycling](https://www.mdpi.com/search?q=human+IFs+and+bicycling); [intelligent surveys](https://www.mdpi.com/search?q=intelligent+surveys)\n\n1. Introduction\n---------------\n\nThe integration of outdoor smartphone applications with fitness trackers, such as smartwatches and fitness rings, has introduced novel use cases for user interaction with mobile devices and reshaped usage patterns. Consequently, this evolution has fostered mobility-driven activities, presenting new opportunities as well as challenges for stakeholders, including urban planners, healthcare providers, service providers, and application developers. There are significant benefits of promoting outdoor mobility and utilizing environmentally sustainable modes of transportation like the reduction of both stress levels and carbon emissions[[1](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/15/12/797#B1-information-15-00797),[2](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/15/12/797#B2-information-15-00797),[3](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/15/12/797#B3-information-15-00797),[4](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/15/12/797#B4-information-15-00797)]. From the perspective of urban planners, the user experience of outdoor mobility has traditionally been assessed through offline surveys or web and mobile applications[[4](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/15/12/797#B4-information-15-00797),[5](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/15/12/797#B5-information-15-00797),[6](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/15/12/797#B6-information-15-00797),[7](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/15/12/797#B7-information-15-00797)]. However, the quality of the user experience is directly influenced by the functionality and usability of mobile devices, as well as the reliability of internet connectivity, factors that fall within the domains of user experience (UX) and quality of experience (QoE). In this paper, we examine the limitations of conventional UX and QoE frameworks and metrics in the context of mobility-driven applications, proposing the concept of adaptable QoE, which enables dynamic user surveys. QoE evaluation scenarios are often static in terms of questions and selectable predefined answers. This paper argues that in dynamic scenarios (e.g., biking activities), a more flexible assessment method is necessary, as the relationship between influencing factors (as defined or hypothesized) and the observed task is context-dependent. The use case applied in this research leverages land cover data and employs dynamic questioning, where users respond based on their actual experiences, rather than a mixture of experiences and perceptions, as is common in survey questionnaires.\n\nThis paper emerged out of an EU-funded research project titled Combined Mobility, which involved the development of a mobile application, VäxlaUpp in the initial stage. The objective of the project was to promote cycling culture in Blekinge and to identify strategies for enhancing the user experience of cyclists. The app was made freely available for both Android and iOS users. The aim was to motivate residents of Blekinge, Sweden, to adopt cycling for daily transportation, thereby promoting improved health and reducing carbon emissions. With the global push towards sustainable and green transportation, cities are investing in cycling infrastructure as a means to reduce carbon emissions, alleviate traffic congestion, and promote public health[[8](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/15/12/797#B8-information-15-00797),[9](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/15/12/797#B9-information-15-00797),[10](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/15/12/797#B10-information-15-00797)].\n\nLand cover information, which describes the physical material on the surface of the Earth, has been traditionally utilized in various sectors such as agriculture, mining, and urban planning[[11](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/15/12/797#B11-information-15-00797),[12](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/15/12/797#B12-information-15-00797),[13](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/15/12/797#B13-information-15-00797),[14](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/15/12/797#B14-information-15-00797),[15](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/15/12/797#B15-information-15-00797)]. Urban planners use land cover data to manage land use, design sustainable cities, and monitor environmental changes. These applications highlight the versatility and importance of accurate land cover information in supporting diverse activities that shape our natural and built environments. While the use of land cover data has primarily focused on these sectors, its application in transportation infrastructure specifically in the development of bicycle paths has become increasingly significant[[16](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/15/12/797#B16-information-15-00797),[17](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/15/12/797#B17-information-15-00797),[18](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/15/12/797#B18-information-15-00797)]. Accurate land cover data are thus essential for the effective planning and segmentation of bicycle paths, allowing for better decision-making in the development of cycling infrastructure. Bicycle path segmentation, which involves identifying and mapping bicycle paths within urban landscapes, is a critical component of transportation infrastructure planning. Traditionally, this task has been approached through manual mapping and field surveys, both of which are labor-intensive and subject to human error. Recent advancements in remote sensing and geospatial technologies have provided new avenues for automating this process. In this paper, we have used Google Earth Engine (GEE)[[19](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/15/12/797#B19-information-15-00797)], which allows researchers to perform complex spatial analyses and extract relevant information at scale. This capability is particularly valuable for urban planners and transportation engineers who need to analyze large areas quickly and efficiently. A Python script was written for processing and analyzing the extracted land cover data. The combination of GEE’s data extraction capabilities and Python’s processing power enables a scalable and efficient approach to bicycle path segmentation.\n\nThe objective of this research is to propose a novel QoE methodology that leverages GEE and mobile applications dedicated to outdoor activities to accurately assess user experiences by incorporating human, system, and contextual influence factors. In this study, by integrating these tools, we aim to provide a reliable and automated solution for identifying bicycle paths in urban environments. Bicycle paths are composed of multiple segments that can be combined and interchanged in various ways to optimize the cycling experience based on weather, path conditions, scenery, and other factors. Our contributions are threefold: First, we demonstrate the limitations of current methods for obtaining user experience feedback related to outdoor activities. Second, we present a Python-based, server-side prototype workflow leveraging GEE to process these data and accurately segment bicycle paths. Finally, we conducted a user survey, gathering real-world feedback from cyclists and analyzing the results to evaluate the benefits of adaptable surveys over traditional methods. This approach is anticipated to generate datasets that more accurately capture users’ experiences, enabling a nuanced understanding of human behavior and satisfaction levels in real-world contexts. This research contributes to the expanding field of user-centric modeling, addressing the need to improve user experience and support infrastructure planning through a novel approach that enhances both the accuracy and efficiency of bicycle path identification. Our methodology enables the capture of authentic user experience feedback within mobility-driven applications, offering valuable insights for stakeholders seeking to promote healthy outdoor activities.\n\nThe structure of this paper is as follows: [Section 2](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/15/12/797#sec2-information-15-00797) provides an overview of the background and a brief exploration of relevant technologies.

Background and Methodological Overview\n-----------------------------------------\n\nThis section reviews related work and provides an overview of land cover classifications, the role of QoE in outdoor sports activities, and its applications in promoting physical activity, which contributes to improved health and a cleaner environment.\n\n### 2.1. Quality of Experience and Outdoor Activities\n\nAs mentioned in [Section 1](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/15/12/797#sec1-information-15-00797), the objective of the research project was to provide users with a mobile application to track their outdoor bicycling activities, promoting better health and reducing the carbon emissions footprint in the Blekinge region of Sweden. The end-user experience can be influenced by numerous factors, including their health and stamina, weather conditions, bicycle path quality, the mobile application itself, internet availability, and more. From a technical perspective, our focus was on collecting accurate data to analyze usage patterns and later present the results to stakeholders through data visualization and other methods. However, this process can be significantly hindered by incomplete sessions due to technical issues such as application unavailability, user interaction problems, or internet disruptions.\n\nThus, to investigate these complex interdependencies of human- and system-related factors, we decided to use quality of experience which is defined by ITU-T as ‘The degree of delight or annoyance of the user of an application or service’[[20](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/15/12/797#B20-information-15-00797)], with reference to full definition that continues with ‘It results from the fulfillment of his or her expectations with respect to the utility and / or enjoyment of the application or service in the light of the user’s personality and current state’[[21](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/15/12/797#B21-information-15-00797)]. This definition primarily addresses the fulfillment of user expectations, which can be shaped by various factors in different forms. To classify these factors, the term influence factor (IF), is defined as ‘Any characteristic of a user, system, service, application, or context whose actual state or setting may have influence on the quality of experience for the user’[[21](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/15/12/797#B21-information-15-00797),[22](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/15/12/797#B22-information-15-00797)].\n\nBased on the definition provided above, numerous influence factors (IFs) can affect user satisfaction with a service. According to the Qualinet White Paper[[21](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/15/12/797#B21-information-15-00797)], these factors are typically categorized into three groups: human, system, and context. [Figure 1](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/15/12/797#fig_body_display_information-15-00797-f001) illustrates various factors within these categories that may influence user expectations during outdoor cycling. A typical scenario of summer and winter cycling, as experienced by users of our application, is depicted. In addition to the human-related IFs mentioned in [Figure 1](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/15/12/797#fig_body_display_information-15-00797-f001), the user experience can be significantly affected by system-related IFs, such as internet disruptions in remote areas, concerns over high battery consumption, or rare instances of application crashes. Furthermore, the user’s mood and their surroundings play a crucial role in motivating cyclists to engage in biking more frequently. QoE primarily focuses on user satisfaction with digital content and is typically quantified using both objective and subjective measures[[23](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/15/12/797#B23-information-15-00797),[24](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/15/12/797#B24-information-15-00797)]. Objective metrics assess the quality of content received such as images, audio, and video by comparing it with the original (full-reference), using metadata from the original (reduced-reference), or based on predetermined quality levels in the absence of the original stimulus (no-reference). Subjective assessments, on the other hand, rely on direct feedback from users, typically quantified using the Mean Opinion Score (MOS) as defined by the International Telecommunication Union[[25](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/15/12/797#B25-information-15-00797)]. This feedback is often obtained through a five-point Absolute Category Rating (ACR) scale[[26](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/15/12/797#B26-information-15-00797)], where 5 indicates “Excellent” and 1 indicates “Bad”.\n\n![Image 12: Information 15 00797 g001](https://www.mdpi.com/information/information-15-00797/article_deploy/html/images/information-15-00797-g001-550.jpg)[](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/15/12/797#fig_body_display_information-15-00797-f001)\n\n**Figure 1.** Factors influencing quality of experience of outdoor bicycling activities. \n\nOne challenge with subjective QoE assessments lies in the fact that MOS was originally developed to evaluate user satisfaction with audio quality in telecommunications and was later extended to multimedia content, with its effectiveness being questioned in many studies[[23](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/15/12/797#B23-information-15-00797),[27](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/15/12/797#B27-information-15-00797),[28](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/15/12/797#B28-information-15-00797),[29](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/15/12/797#B29-information-15-00797),[30](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/15/12/797#B30-information-15-00797),[31](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/15/12/797#B31-information-15-00797),[32](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/15/12/797#B32-information-15-00797),[33](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/15/12/797#B33-information-15-00797),[34](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/15/12/797#B34-information-15-00797)]. Furthermore, in the context of outdoor sports activities, it is difficult to design QoE assessments that align with ITU-T P.910[[26](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/15/12/797#B26-information-15-00797)] and ITU-R BT.500[[35](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/15/12/797#B35-information-15-00797)] recommendations, as these standards are primarily geared toward multimedia quality assessment. Finally, another challenge lies in the fact that QoE influence factors are typically predefined and remain constant to ensure replicability and comparability.\n\n### 2.2. QoE or User Experience\n\nIn light of the issues discussed in the previous section regarding the application of QoE to outdoor sporting activities involving mobile services, some studies have explored the use of user experience (UX) as an alternative framework for evaluating outdoor sports[[36](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/15/12/797#B36-information-15-00797),[37](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/15/12/797#B37-information-15-00797)]. UX focuses on users’ perceptions of digital services, such as mobile applications, and is widely used by developers to design websites and applications that enhance ease of use for end users[[38](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/15/12/797#B38-information-15-00797)]. The importance of context in UX has been emphasized in numerous studies. These studies include surveys of practitioners in software development, focusing on contextual factors, emotional responses, and social aspects[[39](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/15/12/797#B39-information-15-00797)]. Additionally, a dedicated scale tailored to capturing contextual nuances has been evaluated within these investigations[[40](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/15/12/797#B40-information-15-00797)]. Although QoE and UX share some commonalities, there are key differences between the two. A detailed discussion on the relationship between QoE and UX can be found in the book chapter[[41](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/15/12/797#B41-information-15-00797)]. However, in their current forms, neither fully addresses the challenge of quantifying user experience of outdoor activities, particularly considering emerging use cases driven by mobile applications and fitness tracking devices. While QoE objective and subjective metrics are primarily focused on multimedia, traditional quality of service (QoS) metrics, such as bandwidth, packet loss, jitter, etc., may offer some insights to service providers in remote areas. However, they are insufficient for capturing user perception, as they fail to account for various influence factors unrelated to the system.\n\n### 2.3. Landcover Classifications\n\nLandcover refers to the physical composition and types of surface materials present in a given area, such as forests, deserts, vegetation, anthropogenic structures, snow, and more. In agriculture, land cover data are crucial for monitoring crop health, assessing soil conditions, and managing water resources[[11](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/15/12/797#B11-information-15-00797),[42](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/15/12/797#B42-information-15-00797),[43](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/15/12/797#B43-information-15-00797)]. Mining operations rely on this information to evaluate the environmental impact of extraction activities and to rehabilitate land post-mining[[44](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/15/12/797#B44-information-15-00797),[45](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/15/12/797#B45-information-15-00797),[46](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/15/12/797#B46-information-15-00797)]. Landcover is dynamic, subject to temporal changes driven by factors such as weather conditions, natural disasters, and human-induced activities like conflict[[47](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/15/12/797#B47-information-15-00797),[48](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/15/12/797#B48-information-15-00797)]. As a result, continuous monitoring is essential. Thus, the classification and analysis of landcover have significant implications for a variety of applications, including environmental and disaster management, urban planning, and agricultural resource optimization.\n\nYang et al. highlighted that numerous land cover classification systems have been developed at national, regional, and global levels and the lack of interoperability between these systems further complicates the analysis of multi-source, heterogeneous land cover data for diverse applications[[49](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/15/12/797#B49-information-15-00797)]. Thus, landcover can be classified into various categories depending on the specific objectives of the study. In this paper, we utilized the NASA MODIS dataset[[50](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/15/12/797#B50-information-15-00797),[51](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/15/12/797#B51-information-15-00797)] in our prototype implementation, which categorizes landcover into the following classes:\n\n**Water**\n\nWater bodies include inland water reservoirs, rivers, lakes, and oceans.\n\n**Forest**\n\nThe forested class comprises areas dominated by trees, covering tropical forests and mountainous regions with dense trees.\n\n**Shrub, Grass**\n\nGrasslands and shrubs consist of areas covered by small plants, shrubs, and natural grasslands.\n\n**Wetlands**\n\nWetlands are typically characterized by the presence of both water and soil, where water saturation affects the vegetation, as seen in swamps.\n\n**Croplands**\n\nThe agricultural class primarily encompasses vast areas used for cultivation, including the production of vegetables, grains, fruits, and dairy farming.\n\n**Urban**\n\nThe urban class includes areas dominated by human settlements and infrastructure such as cities, transportation networks, and suburbs.\n\n**Crop mosaic**\n\nThe cropland mosaic class is different from croplands due to its heterogeneous nature, characterized by small agricultural fields interspersed with forests, urban areas, or other landcover types.\n\n**Snow and ice**\n\nThe snow and ice class includes areas covered by permanent or seasonal snow and ice, such as glaciers, where temperatures remain low throughout the year.\n\n**Barren**\n\nBarren areas consist of regions with minimal biological activity, such as deserts, salt flats, and rocky landscapes.\n\n**Tundra**\n\nTundra refers to cold regions with sparse vegetation and limited tree cover, with temperatures ranging from −40 °C to 18 °C[[52](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/15/12/797#B52-information-15-00797)]. Unlike snow and ice-covered areas, tundra allows for a short growing season due to slightly warmer conditions during certain parts of the year.\n\nThe MODIS International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IGBP) color palette assigns 18 distinct colors for landcover classification[[19](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/15/12/797#B19-information-15-00797),[51](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/15/12/797#B51-information-15-00797)]. Due to the diversity within the water and forest categories, these classes are represented by five different colors. All other landcover classes are assigned a single color each.\n\nHuang et al.[[16](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/15/12/797#B16-information-15-00797)] demonstrated the integration of spatial data with various data sources by defining ontologies and applying them across a diverse dataset. Their use case involved visualizing urban bicycle paths by combining spatial data with field data, such as signage and speed limits. However, the study primarily focuses on integrating heterogeneous data and does not incorporate land cover information for mobile applications and user experience.\n\nBachechi et al.[[18](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/15/12/797#B18-information-15-00797)] utilized the open-source QGIS tool[[53](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/15/12/797#B53-information-15-00797)] to visualize cycling paths in the province of Modena, Italy. They categorized these paths into five different groups, ranging from dedicated bike lanes to areas lacking separate infrastructure for cyclists. The study primarily focuses on the visualization of bicycle routes and does not incorporate land cover data or investigate user experience.\n\nTo promote bicycle usage in small cities and rural areas, Cordero et al.[[54](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/15/12/797#B54-information-15-00797)] developed a route visualization tool based on data from a travel survey conducted in 2017. The study primarily focuses on urban planning strategies aimed at encouraging healthy activities such as cycling. The tool leverages the ArcGIS[[55](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/15/12/797#B55-information-15-00797)] toolbox for spatial data; however, end-user application and feedback fall outside the study’s scope. Due to privacy constraints, providers of GPS-based outdoor activity data, aggregate this information before it is commercially distributed. Huber et al.[[56](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/15/12/797#B56-information-15-00797)] developed a multi-step mechanism to extract individual cycling routes from aggregated datasets. Their study further estimates user behavior related to route choice in a specific case study conducted in Germany. However, the study does not address route segmentation based on land cover or incorporate user feedback regarding their experience.\n\nBhowmick et al.[[57](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/15/12/797#B57-information-15-00797)] collected a dataset comprising 673 bicyclists across 19,782 trips using GPS data from Melbourne, Australia. A pre-data collection survey questionnaire was designed for appropriate sampling to gather information from adult bikers by recruiting them based on certain parameters. The raw GPS data include information on location, time, and speed. Data collection was conducted through a mobile application and a Bluetooth beacon attached to each participant’s bike. The study does not incorporate land cover information or dynamic feedback for different trip segments. Although this dataset enables the extraction of route segments with land cover application, it remains limited by the absence of context-aware feedback on user experience.\n\n3. Experimental Setup and Methods\n---------------------------------\n\nThe mobile application VäxlaUpp, utilized by over 300 project participants for over a couple of years was available in Swedish. The project included various activities and competitions among active application users, with prizes awarded during social gatherings. The application was updated to provide path segmentation based on land cover data. A demonstration video showcasing path segments and the dynamic questionnaire can be seen via this link[[58](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/15/12/797#B58-information-15-00797)]. As shown in the video, users can view their bicycling routes and, upon selecting a specific trip, observe the entire path in varied colors corresponding to segment types based on land cover information. Users can select individual segments to access questions tailored to that segment’s characteristics, such as safety, lighting conditions, and suitability for winter cycling. Due to screen size constraints, each segment is limited to two context-specific questions. Users also have the option to provide more detailed feedback by accessing the web page.\n\n### 3.1. Conceptualization of Perception and Experience\n\nTraditional user surveys conducted by various stakeholders such as urban planners, contractors, and health officials regarding outdoor activities are typically based on a predefined set of questions, administered either through on-site surveys or digital platforms. The limitations of these conventional methods are illustrated in [Figure 2](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/15/12/797#fig_body_display_information-15-00797-f002). Users are often asked to provide feedback on their perceptions, and data are collected from a broad range of respondents, regardless of their actual experiences. For instance, in a survey about the safety of bicycle paths in remote areas at night, many participants may not have directly encountered these conditions and instead responded solely based on their assumptions. Thus, feedback grounded in assumptions represents preconceived ideas that users form to fill gaps when information is incomplete or unclear. These assumptions are often influenced by prior knowledge, beliefs, or expectations, and while they can provide insight into user expectations or mental models, they also introduce the risk of biases. Such biases may distort the accuracy of the feedback, leading to conclusions that do not fully align with the actual user experience or system performance[[59](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/15/12/797#B59-information-15-00797)]. Recognizing the role of assumptions is critical when analyzing user feedback, as it helps differentiate between genuine insights and speculative conclusions. The experience of a user who has endured the challenges of outdoor activities in remote locations such as internet connectivity disruptions, and anxiety over battery consumption without access to charging facilities would differ significantly from that of a user responding based purely on assumptions, as depicted in [Figure 2](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/15/12/797#fig_body_display_information-15-00797-f002). Nonetheless, the acquired data are often utilized for various visualizations, and subsequent measures are implemented to enhance user experience, even though true user experiences were never adequately quantified.\n\n![Image 13: Information 15 00797 g002](https://www.mdpi.com/information/information-15-00797/article_deploy/html/images/information-15-00797-g002-550.jpg)[](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/15/12/797#fig_body_display_information-15-00797-f002)\n\n**Figure 2.** General vs. adaptable survey questions. \n\nThe use of land cover data and bicycle path segmentation will enable more adaptable user surveys, allowing for the collection of feedback from only those users who have experienced specific routes and conditions. For instance, feedback regarding safety will be solicited solely from users with experience in remote cycling or late evening rides. Additionally, perceptions of safety in outdoor activities may vary based on factors such as gender. Similarly, users who have cycled in winter conditions, with snow and ice as reported by landcover data, will be asked about issues such as debris and road clearance. The dataset obtained from these targeted context-aware surveys will more accurately reflect user experiences, allowing all stakeholders to implement relevant measures that enhance overall user satisfaction.\n\n### 3.2. User Survey\n\nAfter implementing the proposed methodology within the application, we only received 16 inputs from users who had access to the beta version of the application with this functionality. Moreover, no feedback was possible on winter cycling using segments as the project concluded and the application was taken offline before the season. Thus, to obtain user feedback on their experiences, we conducted an online survey by inviting a pool of application users to provide feedback via email, following the prescribed guidelines[[60](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/15/12/797#B60-information-15-00797)]. The decision to conduct an online survey was not merely driven by the application going offline but rather by the need to benchmark user perceptions specifically within the context of Denmark, a country with a strong cycling culture compared to Sweden. In Copenhagen, the feedback was collected from employees of two companies that incentivize cycling through monthly awards based on categories such as usage frequency and total distance traveled. The idea was to obtain user assessments by two different groups and identify different sets of correlations, which would later serve as a benchmark for the results obtained from the new methodology in the future. Thus, the online survey was conducted concurrently in Copenhagen, Denmark, and Blekinge, Sweden, with a total of 49 participants responding to the questionnaire. However, three responses were discarded due to incomplete data. The questionnaire comprised 16 questions focusing on user demographics, type of bicycle used, cycling habits, factors affecting their rides, safety and condition of bicycle paths, factors that could motivate or hinder cycling, winter cycling, and debris clearance. The survey was conducted by following the guidelines of the Swedish Research Council[[60](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/15/12/797#B60-information-15-00797),[61](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/15/12/797#B61-information-15-00797)]. The English version of the survey questions is available in [Appendix A](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/15/12/797#app1-information-15-00797). The survey questions were organized into three categories: Questions 1 to 7 gather general demographic information, reasons for biking, and the type of bicycle used. The remaining questions primarily address various segments categorized by land cover data. Questions 8 through 11 evaluate users’ perceptions of safety and their overall biking experience. Question 12 focuses specifically on taking user feedback on whether they have the experience of winter cycling and the later questions regarding segment 2 in [Appendix A.3](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/15/12/797#secAdot3-information-15-00797) are only displayed to users who cycle during winter months. Similarly, questions regarding snow and ice will be presented exclusively to users identified, based on land cover data, as likely to encounter snowy conditions in winter. Consequently, questions 13 to 16 are tailored to users in snow- and ice-affected areas, exploring their expectations, experiences, and challenges faced while cycling in winter.\n\n### 3.3. Route Segmentation\n\nTo acquire land cover information and subsequently segment the entire route based on variations in land cover classifications, a prototype workflow was developed using a Python script on the server-side. The script utilizes Python version 3.10.11, the Google Earth Engine (GEE) Python API, and the Open Source Computer Vision Library (OpenCV) version 4.7.0[[62](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/15/12/797#B62-information-15-00797),[63](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/15/12/797#B63-information-15-00797)]. The methodology applied for this prototype can be summarized as follows:\n\n*   The GEE add_ee_layer function was employed to overlay land cover information on a Folium map. \n*   The coordinates of the user’s route were obtained from a CSV file extracted from project data. Since these coordinates were not equidistant, a custom function was implemented to adjust the zoom level accordingly. \n*   A snapshot of the Folium map was converted into a Python Imaging Library (PIL) object, and the binary image was converted into PNG format using the Pillow library. OpenCV was then used to convert the image to grayscale, detect contours, and crop the image around the largest detected contour. \n*   Finally, to extract the relevant color information according to the IGBP palette, the hexadecimal color strings were converted into BGR tuples compatible with OpenCV. \n\n[Figure 3](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/15/12/797#fig_body_display_information-15-00797-f003) presents the results of path segmentation applied to two different routes. The segments were generated based on the geographic coordinates extracted from the project dataset, where consecutive latitude–longitude coordinate pairs were transformed into rectangular segments. **Route 1** represents a smaller collection of segments primarily situated in a semi-urban area, bordered by tree cover. In contrast, **Route 2** was selected to demonstrate a more extensive variation in land cover, as it encompasses a 40 km path surrounding the city of Karlskrona, Sweden. It is important to note that the size of the rectangular segments is not uniform—a result of the non-equidistant nature of the input coordinate data. Subsequently, the IGBP color palette was applied to both routes to depict land cover classifications, as illustrated in [Figure 4](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/15/12/797#fig_body_display_information-15-00797-f004). For**Route 1**, only two colors corresponding to semi-urban and forest areas were extracted. In contrast, for**Route 2**, six distinct colors from the IGBP palette were identified: 0xaec3d4 (water), 0xcc0013 (urban), 0x111149 (wetlands), 0x33280d (crop mosaic), 0x387242 (semi-urban/forest), and 0x91af40 (shrub/grass)[[19](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/15/12/797#B19-information-15-00797)]. These results accurately segment the entire route based on the land cover classifications. [Figure 5](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/15/12/797#fig_body_display_information-15-00797-f005) illustrates the actual map displayed to the user, where different segments of the route are distinguished by distinct colors based on land cover classifications. The user should be able to select specific segments, prompting the system to present an adaptive questionnaire tailored to the characteristics of that land cover type. \n\n![Image 14: Information 15 00797 g003](https://www.mdpi.com/information/information-15-00797/article_deploy/html/images/information-15-00797-g003-550.jpg)[](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/15/12/797#fig_body_display_information-15-00797-f003)\n\n**Figure 3.** Path fragmentation. \n\n![Image 15: Information 15 00797 g004](https://www.mdpi.com/information/information-15-00797/article_deploy/html/images/information-15-00797-g004-550.jpg)[](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/15/12/797#fig_body_display_information-15-00797-f004)\n\n**Figure 4.** IGBP color palette application to the path segments. \n\n![Image 16: Information 15 00797 g005](https://www.mdpi.com/information/information-15-00797/article_deploy/html/images/information-15-00797-g005-550.jpg)[](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/15/12/797#fig_body_display_information-15-00797-f005)\n\n**Figure 5.** Displayed map to the users. \n\nAlthough the dataset used in this research comprises bicycle paths, the proposed methodology is versatile and could be applied to various other use cases, such as car journeys or trip planning, to select routes that are more scenic or secure. Additionally, this approach enables the collection of user experience data by focusing on relevant aspects of the route. For instance, questions about scenery or forested areas would not be directed to users who have not encountered those types of land cover segments. As a result, datasets obtained from segment-based application surveys using this methodology would provide a more accurate representation of user experience, contextualized by factors such as time of day and location, rather than relying solely on subjective perceptions or a blend of experience and perception.\n\n4. Results and Discussion\n-------------------------\n\nThe demographic outcomes of the online survey are presented in [Table 1](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/15/12/797#table_body_display_information-15-00797-t001). The survey was conducted concurrently in Blekinge, Sweden, and Copenhagen, Denmark as there is a popular trend of cycling in Copenhagen. This deliberate choice aimed to benchmark the cycling habits and analyze the factors influencing these behaviors. Participants were given the option to respond in either English or Swedish. Participants who had not experienced the challenges of winter cycling were automatically excluded from sections regarding winter conditions, such as ice and snow. However, we were unable to verify the claims of users who indicated experience with winter cycling and harsh conditions, as there was no contextual information available regarding the date, time, location, or the number of users present on that particular segment. This limitation underscores the inherent weaknesses of traditional surveys, regardless of how well the questionnaire is designed or structured. The outcomes of scalable questions can be seen in [Table 2](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/15/12/797#table_body_display_information-15-00797-t002). The majority of respondents rated the quality of bicycle paths and their overall experience as either good or neutral. However, perceptions change during the winter season due to issues related to snow and debris clearance. A detailed analysis considering demographic factors will be provided later in this section.\n\n**Table 1.** Frequency table of user info and online survey language. \n\n![Image 17](https://pub.mdpi-res.com/img/table.png)[](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/15/12/797#table_body_display_information-15-00797-t001)\n\n**Table 2.** User responses to questions based on the hedonic scale. \n\n![Image 18](https://pub.mdpi-res.com/img/table.png)[](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/15/12/797#table_body_display_information-15-00797-t002)\n\nOne of the key insights from user feedback concerned factors that could motivate increased cycling, aligning with the primary aim of the project. Notably, the questionnaire was conducted at the end of the project lifecycle, with participants in Blekinge already utilizing the custom application, unlike those in Copenhagen. This question allowed multiple responses, enabling users to select from any of the provided options. The results are presented in [Table 3](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/15/12/797#table_body_display_information-15-00797-t003). The data should be interpreted row-wise, with the combined percentage representing the proportion of users who selected this factor, irrespective of their country. It is evident that the majority of users prioritized safety and natural surroundings, supporting the hypothesis that cycling motivation increases when routes feature scenic and natural elements. Additionally, options such as adequate lighting and secure parking facilities are closely tied to both personal and equipment safety, further underscoring these as motivating factors. Notably, in environments where safety and a pleasant atmosphere are assured, most users do not feel a significant need for a companion or group cycling, suggesting that a well-designed cycling infrastructure can foster confidence and independence among cyclists.\n\n**Table 3.** User response to multiple options. \n\n![Image 19](https://pub.mdpi-res.com/img/table.png)[](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/15/12/797#table_body_display_information-15-00797-t003)\n\nThe perception of safety while cycling in suburban areas is a critical factor, with notable variations based on gender. [Figure 6](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/15/12/797#fig_body_display_information-15-00797-f006) presents the results, with gender and location (Blekinge and Copenhagen) considered as factors. The most encouraging aspect is that none of the respondents selected the fourth or fifth options, Somewhat unsafe or Very unsafe, respectively, indicating a high level of confidence among Scandinavian users regarding their safety. As anticipated, female cyclists expressed slightly greater safety concerns than their male counterparts. Furthermore, due to Copenhagen’s urban environment and established cycling culture, Danish users reported feeling safer overall compared to those in Blekinge.\n\n![Image 20: Information 15 00797 g006](https://www.mdpi.com/information/information-15-00797/article_deploy/html/images/information-15-00797-g006-550.jpg)[](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/15/12/797#fig_body_display_information-15-00797-f006)\n\n**Figure 6.** Safety perceptions of users. \n\nAnother key aspect concerned user perceptions of cycling path maintenance and their overall cycling experience, inclusive of various contributing factors. [Figure 7](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/15/12/797#fig_body_display_information-15-00797-f007) presents user responses segmented by country. The variables are scaled from 1 to 5, where 1 represents Excellent and 5 represents Bad, as shown in [Appendix A](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/15/12/797#app1-information-15-00797). Consequently, a lower mean value indicates a higher level of user satisfaction. In terms of bicycling path quality, the mean rating for Danish users is higher than that of Swedish users. However, a key observation is that responses from Swedish users are more varied, resulting in higher standard deviation values. Given the expansive land area of the Blekinge region, this suggests that users from different localities may have experienced varying levels of cycling path quality. While there is minimal difference in overall biking experience between the two groups, Swedish respondents again exhibit greater variability in their ratings, as shown in [Figure 7](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/15/12/797#fig_body_display_information-15-00797-f007).\n\n![Image 21: Information 15 00797 g007](https://www.mdpi.com/information/information-15-00797/article_deploy/html/images/information-15-00797-g007-550.jpg)[](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/15/12/797#fig_body_display_information-15-00797-f007)\n\n**Figure 7.** User ratings on hedonic scale for bicycle paths and overall experience. \n\nQuestions 13 to 16 focused on winter cycling, and only users who selected ’Yes’ or ’Maybe’ in response to having a winter cycling experience were allowed to proceed as can be viewed in [Appendix A](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/15/12/797#app1-information-15-00797). This criterion excluded eight respondents who had not cycled in snowy or icy conditions. The results are illustrated in [Figure 8](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/15/12/797#fig_body_display_information-15-00797-f008). Responses were scaled from 1 to 5, with 1 representing Strongly Satisfied and 5 indicating Strongly Unsatisfied. Consequently, a lower mean value reflects a higher level of satisfaction. Although the sample size remains consistent for both groups, the responses from Swedish participants show greater variability, resulting in higher standard deviation values.\n\n![Image 22: Information 15 00797 g008](https://www.mdpi.com/information/information-15-00797/article_deploy/html/images/information-15-00797-g008-550.jpg)[](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/15/12/797#fig_body_display_information-15-00797-f008)\n\n**Figure 8.** User assessments of snow/debris clearance and pathway safety. \n\n### Analysis\n\nIn the context of biking, various environmental factors may impact user experience. To better understand these influences, we conducted two surveys, a segment-based application survey and an online survey to gather users’ perceptions of environmental conditions. The results presented above discussed the environmental factors in terms of frequencies of singular variables, expressed as counts or percentages. To analyze the interdependencies between multiple variables and assess their associations, we computed the correlation coefficients for different questions [[64](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/15/12/797#B64-information-15-00797),[65](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/15/12/797#B65-information-15-00797)]. The surveys included five scalable questions, each addressing a specific environmental factor (see the identifiers in [Appendix A](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/15/12/797#app1-information-15-00797): Q11 pertains to the overall biking experience, Q10 to the quality of the path, Q8 to the safety of the semi-urban route, Q16 to the safety conditions of a path, and Q15 to snowy weather conditions). Given that responses were on an ordinal scale (1 to 5), Spearman’s correlation coefficients [[66](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/15/12/797#B66-information-15-00797)] were applied to measure the impact of these environmental factors.\n\nThe results (see [Table 4](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/15/12/797#table_body_display_information-15-00797-t004)) show that, for all respondents, all factors are positively correlated to the overall biking experience, and the factor of path quality has the most correlation as compared to the others. Meanwhile, a p-value greater than 0.05 (with 95% confidence) indicates that the safety of the semi-urban route was not significantly correlated to the overall biking experience.\n\n**Table 4.** Relation between overall biking experience and IFs based on the entire group of subjects. \n\n![Image 23](https://pub.mdpi-res.com/img/table.png)[](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/15/12/797#table_body_display_information-15-00797-t004)\n\nAdditionally, given that these factors were subjectively perceived, we performed correlation analyses across different respondent groups to assess the consistency of associations between overall biking experience and its influencing factors. The resulting correlation coefficients for each group are presented in the following tables, with consistency indicated by the p-value. For a given factor (represented by each row in the table), if the p-value is significant in one group but not in another, this indicates an inconsistent association between the factor and overall biking experience. Conversely, if the p-values in different groups are all significant or insignificant, it means the association between the corresponding factor and overall biking experience is consistent. For gender (see [Table 5](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/15/12/797#table_body_display_information-15-00797-t005)), an inconsistency is observed for the factor of road safety conditions, as the p-value in the female group exceeds 0.05, while in the male group, the positive correlation with overall biking experience is significant. Regarding nationality (see [Table 6](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/15/12/797#table_body_display_information-15-00797-t006)), inconsistencies emerge for both safety conditions and biking during snowy or icy conditions. [Table 7](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/15/12/797#table_body_display_information-15-00797-t007) presents the correlation coefficients between biking influence factors and the purpose of biking. Notably, this question was one of three that allowed participants to provide multiple responses. The results indicate that only path quality consistently aligns with users’ responses across different biking purposes.\n\n**Table 5.** Relation between overall biking experience and IFs based on different genders. \n\n![Image 24](https://pub.mdpi-res.com/img/table.png)[](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/15/12/797#table_body_display_information-15-00797-t005)\n\n**Table 6.** Relation between overall biking experience and IFs based on different nationalities. \n\n![Image 25](https://pub.mdpi-res.com/img/table.png)[](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/15/12/797#table_body_display_information-15-00797-t006)\n\n**Table 7.** Relationship between overall biking experience and IFs across different biking purposes. \n\n![Image 26](https://pub.mdpi-res.com/img/table.png)[](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/15/12/797#table_body_display_information-15-00797-t007)\n\nAlthough the feedback was collected through an online survey, the analysis highlights which environmental factors may influence the overall biking experience and how this impact varies based on user perceptions. This underscores the challenge of assessing general user experience based on perceived environmental factors, especially in highly dynamic conditions. Consequently, we emphasize the need for adaptive surveys to capture more accurate and context-sensitive feedback on user experience.\n\nMeanwhile, the relationship between overall biking experience and environmental influence factors, as indicated by an online survey and initial results from the segment-based application survey, shows correlation coefficients of 69%69% and 85%85%, respectively, for the path factor. In contrast, this relationship yields coefficients of 19%19% and 30%30%, respectively, for the safety factor. These preliminary results indicate different degrees of correlations, while their directions and strengths are close to each other. This is a promising observation, as it (a) indicates the potential of additional insights from the proposed method, while (b) still following the same expected trends. We conclude that the application method provides a valuable perspective by quantifying the experience based on real physical interactions, a detailed study of which is left for future work.\n\n5. Conclusions\n--------------\n\nIn this paper, we have proposed a novel approach to the user experience for mobility-driven applications by enabling route selection based on individualized factors such as safety, environmental quality, and scenery. With the successful implementation of our prototype, we can now provide an adaptable, context-aware questionnaire that captures users’ experiences in real-time. The resulting datasets gathered from user feedback through this path segmentation and customized questioning approach will empower stakeholders to make informed, contextually relevant decisions. This study highlights the need to expand existing QoE methodologies, as new use cases are likely to emerge with mobile applications supporting outdoor activities, spanning areas such as outdoor sports, healthcare, transportation, and urban planning, where user feedback is critical. Future work will focus on creating new datasets through this approach and benchmarking these with established feedback from this study for comprehensive evaluation.\n\nAuthor Contributions\n--------------------\n\nConceptualization, O.N. and S.K.; methodology, O.N., S.K. and M.F.; software, O.N.; application survey, O.N., Y.Z. and S.K.; online survey, O.N. and Y.Z.; results compilation, O.N. and Y.Z.; validation, S.K. and M.F.; writing—original draft, O.N. and Y.Z.; writing—review and editing, S.K. and M.F.; supervision, S.K. and M.F.
