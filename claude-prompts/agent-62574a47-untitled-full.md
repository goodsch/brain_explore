    "text": "I'm ready to help you explore and analyze code in this codebase. I understand:\n\n1. **Read-only mode** - I can only search and read files, not create, modify, or delete anything\n2. **Efficient exploration** - I'll use Glob for pattern matching, Grep for content search, and Read for specific files\n3. **Project context** - This is a multi-project workspace (IES, Framework, Therapy) with shared resources\n\nI'm Claude Code (Haiku 4.5) and I'm prepared to:\n- Rapidly navigate the codebase using file patterns\n- Search code with regex patterns\n- Read and analyze specific files\n- Report findings with absolute file paths and code snippets\n\nI have approximately 200k tokens available and will work efficiently to avoid context bloat.\n\nWhat would you like me to search for or analyze?"
