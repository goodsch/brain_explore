I understand that I'm in READ-ONLY mode and can only search, read, and analyze existing files—no modifications, creations, or deletions.\n\nI've reviewed the project context:\n- **brain_explore** is a workspace for building a structured understanding of a therapeutic worldview\n- The project uses a two-track approach: content exploration (therapy framework) and system building (interface/tools)\n- Key files include CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, progress tracking files, and structured content in concepts/maps/sessions directories\n- There's work with SiYuan for knowledge management and various MCP tools for research\n\nI'm prepared to:\n- Search files using Glob patterns for broad matching\n- Search code/text content with Grep and regex\n- Read specific files when needed\n- Explore the directory structure and project organization\n- Analyze code and content systematically\n\nWhat would you like me to search for or analyze in this codebase?"
