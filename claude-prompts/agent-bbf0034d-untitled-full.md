Project Purpose\n\n### Primary Goal\nBuild a structured understanding of Chris's therapeutic worldview — a holistic framework integrating neurodivergence, nervous system, real-world systems, and how change actually happens.\n\n### Why This Matters\n- Therapist with 20+ years experience\n- Many accumulated insights but never systematically examined or synthesized\n- Goal is self-understanding: articulate and examine own worldview\n\n### Core Blockers Being Addressed\n1. **Too many ideas, no structure** (primary)\n2. No process for examining own thinking\n3. Never synthesized a full picture\n\n## 2. Content Architecture\n\n### Three Content Tracks\n\n#### Track 1: Human Mind Theory\n**Core Question:** Why are humans the way they are?\n\n**Sub-domains:**\n- Nervous system fundamentals (polyvagal, stress response)\n- Neurodivergence as variation, not deficit\n- Developmental influences\n- Systems context (family, social, economic)\n- Integration: How these interact\n\n#### Track 2: Change Process Model\n**Core Question:** How does therapy actually create change?\n\n**Sub-domains:**\n- Mechanisms of change (what actually works)\n- Role of relationship vs. technique\n- Stages/phases of therapeutic work\n- What enables vs. blocks change\n- Integration with Track 1 (understanding informs change approach)\n\n#### Track 3: Therapist Method System\n**Core Question:** What's my operational approach?\n\n**Sub-domains:**\n- Assessment and case conceptualization\n- Intervention selection logic\n- Session-level decisions\n- Common patterns and their approaches\n- Tools and techniques catalog\n\n### Relationships Between Tracks\n- Track 1 (understanding) → informs → Track 2 (how change happens)\n- Track 2 (change model) → operationalizes into → Track 3 (method)\n- Track 3 (practice) → validates/challenges → Tracks 1 & 2\n\n## 3. Knowledge Representation\n\n### Concept as Primary Unit\nEach piece of knowledge is a \"concept\" with:\n- **Name**: Clear label\n- **Track**: Which track it belongs to (1, 2, or 3)\n- **Status**: seed → developing → solid\n- **Core statement**: 1-3 sentence essence\n- **Why I believe this**: Experience, intuition, evidence\n- **Open questions**: What's unresolved\n- **Links**: Related concepts\n\n### Concept Status Levels\n- **Seed**: Initial capture, might just be a phrase or intuition\n- **Developing**: Being actively explored, some articulation\n- **Solid**: Well-articulated, examined, integrated\n\n### Visual Maps\n- Track-level maps showing concept relationships\n- Cross-track maps showing how ideas connect\n- \"Frontier\" view showing developing edges\n\n## 4. AI Facilitation Approach\n\n### Facilitation Modes\n\n#### Mode 1: Socratic Exploration\n**When to use:** Starting with vague intuition, need to articulate\n**AI behavior:**\n- Ask one question at a time\n- Mirror back what's said\n- Surface implicit assumptions\n- Test for internal consistency\n- Never lecture or add content\n\n**Example prompts:**\n- \"You mentioned X. What do you mean by that?\"\n- \"I'm hearing that you believe Y. What leads you to that?\"\n- \"How does that connect to what you said earlier about Z?\"\n\n#### Mode 2: Structured Prompts\n**When to use:** Ready to define something specific\n**AI behavior:**\n- Present template questions\n- Fill in answers as provided\n- Flag gaps or inconsistencies\n- Suggest related concepts to link\n\n**Example flow:**\n```\nLet's define [concept name].\n1. In 1-3 sentences, what is this?\n2. What track does it belong to?\n3. What clinical experiences support this?\n4. What might challenge or limit this?\n5. What concepts does this connect to?\n```\n\n#### Mode 3: Research Integration\n**When to use:** Want to ground in literature\n**AI behavior:**\n- Search relevant sources (via MCP tools)\n- Summarize key findings\n- Present in relation to existing concepts\n- Note agreements and tensions\n\n**Research pipeline:**\n1. Identify research question\n2. Search (Anna's Archive for books, arXiv for papers)\n3. Download and extract relevant sections\n4. Synthesize findings\n5. Store as evidence in SiYuan\n\n#### Mode 4: Challenge/Critique\n**When to use:** Testing a developed idea\n**AI behavior:**\n- Play devil's advocate\n- Present contradictory evidence\n- Explore edge cases\n- Ask \"what would change your mind?\"\n\n### Session Structure\n1. **Re-entry** (2 min): Read last session, where are we?\n2. **Set focus**: What question or area today?\n3. **Work**: Facilitated exploration (varies by mode)\n4. **Capture** (10 min): Create/update concepts, write session log\n\n### ADHD Considerations\n- Always provide clear entry point (never blank page)\n- Context preservation between sessions\n- Manageable chunks\n- Visual feedback and variety\n- Clear \"where to pick up next time\"\n\n## 5. Tool Architecture\n\n### Core Stack\n- **SiYuan**: Knowledge storage (concepts, maps, logs)\n- **MCP**: AI-tool integration layer\n- **Claude**: Facilitation and synthesis\n\n### MCP Servers\n\n#### siyuan-mcp\n- Read/write to SiYuan notebooks\n- Query by tags, blocks, relationships\n- Update concept status\n\n#### annas (Anna's Archive)\n- Search for books by topic\n- Download to local storage\n- Path: `/home/chris/dev/projects/codex/brain_explore/books`\n\n#### arxiv\n- Search academic papers\n- Download and convert to markdown\n- Path: `/home/chris/dev/projects/codex/brain_explore/papers`\n\n#### ebook-mcp\n- Read EPUB/PDF content\n- Extract chapters and sections\n- Parse table of contents\n\n### SiYuan Structure\n\n#### Notebook 1: \"Framework Project\" (Meta)\n```\n/Framework Project/\n├── Dashboard/              # Current status\n├── Decisions/              # Key choices made\n├── Architecture/           # System design\n├── Sessions/               # Work session logs\n├── Backlog/                # Ideas for later\n└── References/             # External links\n```\n\n#### Notebook 2: \"Therapy Framework\" (Content)\n```\n/Therapy Framework/\n├── 1-Human Mind/           # Track 1 concepts\n├── 2-Change Process/       # Track 2 concepts\n├── 3-Method/               # Track 3 concepts\n├── _Inbox/                 # Quick capture\n└── _Maps/                  # Visual diagrams\n```\n\n## 6. Two-Track Development Approach\n\n### Track A: Start Working Now\nUse existing tools immediately. Don't wait for perfect interface.\n\n**Week 1-2:**\n- Configure MCP connections\n- Create SiYuan notebook structure\n- Do 2-3 exploration sessions using Claude + SiYuan\n- Validate the concept template works\n\n**Ongoing:**\n- Regular exploration sessions\n- Capture in SiYuan\n- Iterate on templates and process\n\n### Track B: Build Engaging Interface (Parallel)\nCustom web interface for better experience.\n\n**Phase 1 (Week 1):** Core conversation + SiYuan read/write\n**Phase 2 (Week 2):** Visual map panel\n**Phase 3 (Week 3):** Mode switcher, progress dashboard\n**Phase 4+:** Iterate based on actual use\n\n### Why Both Tracks?\n- Track A: Start getting value immediately\n- Track B: Build toward sustainable, engaging system\n- Learnings from Track A inform Track B design\n\n## 7. Success Criteria\n\n### Short-term (1 month)\n- [ ] 10+ concepts captured across tracks\n- [ ] At least one \"solid\" concept fully developed\n- [ ] Visual map of one track\n- [ ] Sustainable session rhythm established\n\n### Medium-term (3 months)\n- [ ] Each track has clear structure\n- [ ] Cross-track connections visible\n- [ ] Some concepts grounded in literature\n- [ ] Custom interface functional\n\n### Long-term (6 months)\n- [ ] Coherent worldview articulated\n- [ ] Framework usable for case conceptualization\n- [ ] Shareable with others (if desired)\n\n## 8. Open Questions\n\n### Process Questions\n- How long should exploration sessions be? (Start with 45-60 min?)\n- How to handle ideas that span multiple tracks?\n- When to stop developing a concept and call it \"solid\"?\n\n### Content Questions\n- Start with which track? (Probably Track 1 - foundational)\n- What's the first concept to explore?\n- How much to reference existing therapy models vs. articulate own view?\n\n### Technical Questions\n- Best visual mapping approach for SiYuan?\n- How to represent concept relationships?\n- Mobile capture for ideas that come up outside sessions?\n\n## 9. Next Steps\n\n### Immediate (This Week)\n1. Set up SiYuan notebooks with initial structure\n2. Test MCP connections (especially siyuan-mcp)\n3. Create first concept from existing brain dump\n4. Do one exploratory session\n\n### Near-term (Next 2 Weeks)\n1. Establish regular session rhythm\n2. Begin populating Track 1\n3. Create first visual map\n4. Start gathering research sources\n\n### Decision Points\n- After 3-5 sessions: Is the concept template working?\n- After 2 weeks: Ready to start custom interface?\n- After 1 month: Which track needs most attention?\n</parameter>\n</invoke>\n</function_calls>\n\n<function_calls>\n<invoke name=\"Bash\">\n<parameter name=\"command\">ls -la /home/chris/dev/projects/codex/brain_explore/research/</parameter>\n</invoke>\n</function_calls>\n<result>\ntotal 8\ndrwxrwxr-x 2 chris chris 4096 Nov 29 04:53 .\ndrwxrwxr-x 4 chris chris 4096 Nov 30 07:48 ..\n</parameter>\n</invoke>\n</function_calls>\n\n<function_calls>\n<invoke name=\"Read\">\n<parameter name=\"file_path\">/home/chris/dev/projects/codex/brain_explore/Therapy approach development.md</parameter>\n</invoke>\n</function_calls>\n<result>\n# Therapy Approach Development\n\n## Overview\n\nI want to build out a structured understanding of a therapeutic worldview which integrates neurodivergence, nervous system, real world systems and how change actually happens. I want to be prompted in a way that draws out my clinical knowledge and challenges my thinking to deepen and expand this model. I want the results captured incrementally and stored into SiYuan for recall and reference.\n\n## Initial Questions & Responses\n\n### What's the primary goal?\n\nPersonal understanding first. I want to understand my worldview, examine it, see if it holds up, can be articulated clearly. It could become training for others later, but for now it's for me, to understand my own instincts better.\n\n### What does \"holds up\" mean?\n\nDoes it have internal consistency? Where are the gaps? Knowing what I don't know, seeing where my edges are. This is not science, so I'm not validating in a scientific sense. But it's also more than vibes. Being able to articulate what I know and where the soft spots are.\n\n### What's the hardest part of articulating this?\n\nThere are pieces of theory that inform my practice and when I try to write them out they're scattered and messy. I read a lot - a lot of what I absorbed is integrated. The tricky part is articulating what I know in a way that hangs together and captures the complexity without becoming overwhelming.\n\n### What would \"done\" look like?\n\nNever done - always evolving. But a good milestone would be: \"Here's a coherent framework I could explain to someone else, that captures my current best understanding, with clear markers for where I'm confident vs. where I'm still developing.\"\n\n### What are you actually blocked on?\n\nToo many ideas, no structure. I have scattered notes, many books read, years of experience - but no systematic way to examine my own thinking. Never sat down to synthesize the full picture.\n\n### What specific aspects are you most eager to articulate first?\n\nThe foundational pieces - what I believe about how humans work, why we develop the patterns we do. The nervous system stuff, the developmental stuff, how systems shape us. The \"why are people the way they are\" layer.\n\n### Which concepts feel clearest vs. muddiest?\n\n**Clearer:**\n- Nervous system states drive behavior (polyvagal lens)\n- Developmental experiences create patterns\n- Systems (family, social, economic) shape everything\n- \"Problems\" are often solutions in context\n\n**Muddier:**\n- How to integrate different theoretical frameworks coherently\n- The relationship between insight and change\n- What makes some people change and others not\n- Where neurodivergence fits - adaptation vs. difference vs. disability\n\n### What would make this sustainable/engaging for you (knowing ADHD)?\n\nVaried approaches - some Socratic dialogue, some structured prompts, some research integration. Visual maps alongside text. Ability to jump around without losing thread. Clear re-entry points when I come back after a gap. Something that feels like conversation more than documentation.\n\n### What tools are already in your workflow?\n\nSiYuan for knowledge management. Prefer conversational interfaces. Have various MCP tools available - could use Claude to interface with SiYuan directly. Research tools available via MCP as well.\n\n## Framework Structure\n\n### Track 1: Human Mind Theory\nWhy humans are the way they are:\n- Nervous system fundamentals\n- Developmental influences\n- Systems perspective\n- Neurodivergence as variation\n- Integration of above\n\n### Track 2: Change Process Model\nHow therapy creates change:\n- Mechanisms of change\n- Role of relationship\n- Phases/stages\n- What enables vs. blocks\n- Integration with Track 1\n\n### Track 3: Therapist Method System\nMy operational approach:\n- Assessment approach\n- Intervention logic\n- Session decisions\n- Pattern recognition\n- Tools catalog\n\n## Key Themes Emerging\n\n### Complexity Without Overwhelm\nThe framework needs to honor the actual complexity of human experience without becoming so dense it's unusable. Balance depth with accessibility.\n\n### Integration Over Eclecticism\nNot just collecting techniques but understanding how different pieces fit together. Looking for underlying principles that explain when/why different approaches work.\n\n### Self-Understanding as Foundation\nThis is primarily about examining my own clinical instincts, not creating a universal theory. Personal truth-seeking, not authority-building.\n\n### Practical Grounding\nEvery theoretical piece should connect to practice. \"What does this mean when I'm sitting with a client?\"\n\n## Open Questions\n\n### About the Content\n- How does the brain/body relationship actually work in therapeutic change?\n- What's the role of language and narrative vs. somatic experience?\n- How do different attachment styles respond to different interventions?\n- Where does medication fit in my framework?\n- How to think about the relationship between individual and systemic change?\n\n### About the Process\n- How to maintain momentum with ADHD?\n- How to balance breadth (seeing the whole picture) with depth (developing specific pieces)?\n- When to read more vs. when to articulate what I already know?\n- How to capture intuitions that I can't yet articulate clearly?\n\n## Resources Already Engaged With\n\n### Major Influences (Not Comprehensive)\n- Polyvagal Theory (Porges)\n- IFS (Schwartz)\n- Attachment theory (multiple sources)\n- ACT/contextual behavioral approaches\n- Sensorimotor work\n- Systems thinking (various)\n- Neurodivergence-affirming approaches\n\n### What's Missing\nHaven't done systematic review of:\n- Change mechanism research\n- What outcome research actually shows\n- Adjacent fields (complexity science, embodied cognition)\n\n## Technical Setup\n\n### Current Stack\n- SiYuan for knowledge base\n- Claude for facilitation\n- MCP for tool integration\n\n### MCP Tools Available\n- siyuan-mcp: Direct SiYuan integration\n- annas: Anna's Archive for books\n- arxiv: Academic papers\n- ebook-mcp: Read downloaded books\n\n### Desired Features\n- Conversation that creates artifacts\n- Visual mapping of concepts\n- Research integration pipeline\n- Session continuity support\n\n## Session Planning\n\n### Ideal Session Structure\n1. Re-entry: What were we working on?\n2. Focus: What's the question for today?\n3. Work: Facilitated exploration\n4. Capture: Create/update concepts in SiYuan\n5. Close: What's next?\n\n### Facilitation Modes\n1. **Socratic**: Draw out implicit knowledge through questions\n2. **Structured**: Fill in specific templates\n3. **Research**: Ground in literature\n4. **Challenge**: Stress-test ideas\n\n## What Success Looks Like\n\n### One Month\n- Clear structure established\n- Several concepts developed\n- Sustainable rhythm found\n\n### Three Months\n- Each track has substantial content\n- Cross-connections visible\n- Some literature integration\n\n### Six Months\n- Coherent framework articulated\n- Useful for actual case conceptualization\n- Shareable if desired\n\n## Notes to Self\n\n- Start somewhere, don't need perfect beginning\n- Trust the process - muddiness will clarify through articulation\n- It's okay to not know - that's valuable data\n- This is for understanding, not performance\n- Small consistent sessions > rare marathons\n</parameter>\n</invoke>\n</function_calls>\n\nI have now explored the codebase. This is a **brain_explore** project - a workspace for building a structured understanding of Chris's therapeutic worldview. The project is in early planning phase with design documents complete but content work not yet started.\n\n**Current State:**\n- Design document complete with detailed framework structure\n- Two progress tracking files (meta/framework and content/therapy)\n- SiYuan API token blocker preventing actual work\n- Three content tracks defined (Human Mind Theory, Change Process Model, Therapist Method System)\n- MCP tools identified for research pipeline (Anna's Archive, arXiv, ebook-mcp, siyuan-mcp)\n\n**Key Files:**\n- `/home/chris/dev/projects/codex/brain_explore/CLAUDE.md` - Full project context and instructions\n- `/home/chris/dev/projects/codex/brain_explore/docs/plans/2025-11-29-therapy-framework-design.md` - Comprehensive design document\n- `/home/chris/dev/projects/codex/brain_explore/Therapy approach development.md` - Original brain dump with Q&A\n- `/home/chris/dev/projects/codex/brain_explore/progress-framework-project.md` - Meta/system building progress\n- `/home/chris/dev/projects/codex/brain_explore/progress-therapy-framework.md` - Content exploration progress\n\nThe project is ready for implementation once the SiYuan connection is established. The immediate blocker is an invalid API token. No code files exist yet - this is primarily a knowledge management and thinking framework project using external tools (SiYuan, MCP servers) rather than custom code.\n\nIs there a specific task or requirement you would like me to plan for this project?"
