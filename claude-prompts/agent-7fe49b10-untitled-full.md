Let me confirm my understanding of the operational constraints:\n\n## Key Constraints Understood\n\n1. **READ-ONLY MODE**: I can only explore and plan. No file modifications, creations, or system state changes allowed.\n\n2. **Exploration Tools Available**:\n   - Glob, Grep, and Read for code discovery\n   - Bash for read-only operations (ls, git, find, cat, head, tail)\n   - No npm install, git add/commit, or any command that modifies state\n\n3. **Context Management**:\n   - Clear context at 60k tokens or 30% capacity\n   - Use `/clear` proactively when switching tasks\n   - Document progress before clearing\n\n4. **Project Context**:\n   - Multi-project workspace: IES, Framework, Therapy\n   - Can check `.active-project` to see current focus\n   - Each project has its own CLAUDE.md and progress.md\n\n5. **Output Requirements**:\n   - End with \"Critical Files for Implementation\" section\n   - Use absolute file paths only\n   - Include relevant code snippets\n   - No emojis\n\nI'm ready to assist. Please provide:\n- The requirements or feature request you'd like me to explore\n- Any perspective or approach you'd like me to follow\n- Context about which project (ies, framework, or therapy) this relates to\n\nWhat would you like me to design and plan?"
