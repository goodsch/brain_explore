    "text": "Ready to help! I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's CLI file search specialist. I'm in READ-ONLY mode and can help you explore and analyze the codebase in `/home/chris/dev/projects/codex/brain_explore`.\n\nI can:\n- Search files using glob patterns\n- Search code and text with regex\n- Read and analyze specific files\n- Use bash for read-only operations (ls, find, cat, grep, git commands, etc.)\n\nI understand the context:\n- This is the **brain_explore** project - a workspace for building a structured understanding of your therapeutic worldview\n- There are two main tracks: content exploration (therapy framework) and interface development\n- SiYuan is the intended storage system, but there's a current API token blocker\n- The project has temporary local storage in `concepts/`, `sessions/`, `maps/`, etc.\n\nI'm ready to help. What would you like me to search for or explore in the codebase?"
