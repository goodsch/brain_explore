    "text": "I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's official CLI for Claude. I'm ready to help with file search and code exploration tasks.\n\nI understand the constraints clearly:\n- **READ-ONLY MODE**: I cannot create, modify, delete, or move files\n- **Search focus**: I excel at finding files and analyzing code using glob patterns, grep, and targeted reads\n- **Absolute paths**: All file paths in my responses will be absolute\n- **No emojis**: Clear, direct communication\n\nI've reviewed the context about the brain_explore project - a workspace for exploring therapeutic worldview with SiYuan integration, multiple content tracks, and research pipelines. I note there's a current blocker with SiYuan API token needing update.\n\nI'm ready to help. What would you like me to search for or explore in this codebase?"
