A good place to start might be what i know theoretically that underpins my worldview, things like neurodivergence, nervous system, capitalism and real world systems, and of course how change happens. \n\nI know i also want to do something similar with practical knowledge/clinical knowledge specifically, understanding what i'm actually doing rather than what i'm claiming to be doing - a way to observe myself. but that's pretty different and can be a different project.\n\nWhen i think about what i want with the worldview project it's a combination of two things:\n1. I want to know what i already know but don't have articulated. This is like synthesis from disparate sources, but it's not like integrating research, it's like extracting from myself, surfacing what i've already thought and developed.\n2. I want to fill in the gaps. i know there are blanks that prevent my framework from being complete. things i haven't thought about before, things i've avoided thinking about, and things i've thought about but never satisfied myself. if i could name these and either reconcile or leave as genuinely open questions that would be good.\n\n## Q&A Exploration\n\n### 1. Clarifying the Core Goal\n\n**Q: When you imagine having successfully completed this project, what does that look like? What can you do that you can't do now?**\n\nA: I think I'd be able to talk confidently about what I believe rather than always qualifying and wondering. Also I'd love to have something external that I can look at and examine and poke at. Right now my worldview feels like it's embedded in me - I have clinical instincts and they come from somewhere but I couldn't draw them out and look at them.\n\n**Q: You mentioned wanting to \"examine\" your worldview. What does examining it mean to you? Are you looking to validate it, challenge it, refine it, or something else?**\n\nA: All of those I think. Like I want to know what I actually believe (not what I think I should believe), then see if it holds up, find the weak spots, and make it stronger or simpler. Sometimes I suspect I have contradictions I'm not aware of.\n\n**Q: Is there a specific domain you want to start with? You mentioned neurodivergence, nervous system, capitalism/systems, and change processes. Do any of these feel more foundational or urgent?**\n\nA: How change happens feels most foundational. Everything else feeds into that - like understanding ND or nervous system only matters therapeutically because of how it relates to change. But I'm also aware I might need to understand those building blocks first before I can articulate my change theory.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Understanding the \"Extraction\" Problem\n\n**Q: You said it's \"not like integrating research, it's like extracting from myself.\" Can you describe what extracting from yourself would feel like if it was working? What kind of prompts or interactions help you surface what you already know?**\n\nA: When it works it's like... someone asks me the right question and suddenly I'm talking and I realize I know more than I thought. Or I'm explaining something to a client and I hear myself say something that surprises me. The thing that helps is specific questions, not \"what do you think about X\" but more like \"what do you do when Y happens\" or \"why did you choose Z in that moment\"\n\n**Q: When you've had breakthroughs in articulating your ideas before (even small ones), what was the context? Were you writing, talking, being interviewed, teaching...?**\n\nA: Definitely talking more than writing. And specifically explaining to someone who's curious but not in my field - like I have to translate. Also when I'm slightly challenged, like someone says \"but what about...\" and I have to defend or clarify. Writing alone I tend to either produce word salad or get stuck staring at the page.\n\n**Q: You mention having \"clinical instincts.\" If you think of a recent moment where your instincts guided you in session, can you describe what happened and why you did what you did?**\n\nA: Sure - recently a client was intellectualizing about their relationship and I noticed I was getting a bit bored/disconnected, and instead of asking another question I said \"I notice I'm finding it hard to stay with you right now\" and that completely shifted things - they started crying and we got somewhere real. I did that because... I don't know, it felt like the intellectual talk was a defense and the realest thing in the room was our connection, so I used it. But I couldn't have told you that's what I was doing in the moment.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Structure and Process\n\n**Q: You mentioned using SiYuan to manage the knowledge. Have you tried using it for this before? What worked or didn't work?**\n\nA: I've used SiYuan for lots of things and I like it. But for this specifically I've started a few times and abandoned it. I think I didn't have a clear structure and just started making notes that didn't connect. Also I'd make a note and then never look at it again because there was no process for returning to things.\n\n**Q: What would help you not abandon this project like previous attempts? What do you need to stay engaged?**\n\nA: I need it to feel like it's going somewhere, like I can see progress. Also I need variety - if it's just answering questions for hours I'll burn out. And I need re-entry points - if I leave for a week I need to be able to come back without feeling lost.\n\n**Q: How much time/energy do you realistically want to put into this? Are we talking 15 minutes a day, a few hours a week, deep dives occasionally?**\n\nA: Realistically a few hours a week, maybe in 30-60 minute chunks. I could probably do a longer session occasionally if it's engaging but I wouldn't plan around that.\n\n---\n\n### 4. The Gap-Filling Piece\n\n**Q: You mentioned wanting to \"fill in the gaps\" and name things you've avoided or never satisfied yourself on. Can you give an example of a gap you're aware of?**\n\nA: One big one is my actual theory of mind/consciousness. I have practical approaches to working with parts, with the nervous system, with patterns - but I've never really worked out what I think consciousness IS or how the mind actually works at a fundamental level. I kind of avoid it because it feels too philosophical and abstract.\n\n**Q: When you encounter gaps, what's your usual response? Do you research, sit with uncertainty, construct something provisional, or...?**\n\nA: Mostly avoid and hope it doesn't come up! Or construct something provisional in the moment and then forget what I said. I rarely research - it feels overwhelming and I'm not sure what sources to trust. When I do sit with uncertainty it's uncomfortable but sometimes productive.\n\n**Q: How would you want to handle gaps in this system? Flag them as open questions? Actively research them? Some combination?**\n\nA: I think flag them as open questions first, and then have a way to optionally dig in if I want to. Like the system should tolerate uncertainty rather than forcing me to resolve everything. But also give me tools if I want to go deeper.\n\n---\n\n### 5. The Contradiction Question\n\n**Q: You said you suspect you have contradictions you're not aware of. Can you give an example of two things you believe that might be in tension?**\n\nA: Hmm. I believe that people have genuine agency and capacity for choice. But I also believe that behaviour makes sense in context and that people do the best they can with what they have. Sometimes those feel like they conflict - like am I saying people could choose differently or that they couldn't?\n\n**Q: How would you want the system to handle these tensions? Surface them explicitly? Help you resolve them? Hold them as productive paradoxes?**\n\nA: Surface them explicitly definitely. Then I want help figuring out if they're actual contradictions (one must be wrong), productive paradoxes (both true in different ways), or just poorly specified (I'm using words loosely). Don't resolve them for me but help me see them clearly.\n\n---\n\n### 6. Practical Knowledge Project (briefly)\n\n**Q: You mentioned wanting to separately understand \"what I'm actually doing\" vs \"what I'm claiming to be doing.\" Can you say more about what prompted this? What's the gap you're noticing?**\n\nA: Sometimes I describe my approach one way but I suspect if you watched my sessions you'd see something different. Like I might say I'm \"client-led\" but actually I'm quite directive sometimes. I want to know what I actually do, not what I aspire to or think I should do.\n\n**Q: How separate is this from the worldview project? Could they inform each other or would that create confusion?**\n\nA: They're definitely related but I think they need different approaches. The worldview stuff is more intellectual/theoretical. The practical stuff is more observational. Maybe the worldview project could inform what to look for in the practical one? But I wouldn't try to do both at once.\n\n---\n\n### 7. What Would Make This Engaging\n\n**Q: You mentioned needing variety and progress visibility. What kinds of interactions feel engaging to you? Debates? Exploring scenarios? Visual mapping? Building definitions?**\n\nA: Ooh, all of those actually. I like when things get visual - like seeing connections between ideas. I like concrete scenarios where I have to apply my thinking. I like debates/challenges but not aggressive ones. Building definitions is satisfying when I nail something. The thing I don't like is answering the same kind of question over and over with no variety.\n\n**Q: Is there anything you definitely DON'T want in this process?**\n\nA: I don't want to feel stupid or like my ideas are naive. I don't want pressure to be comprehensive or systematic before I'm ready. I don't want to have to read loads of stuff - I want to start from what I already think and add reading selectively.\n\n**Q: When you imagine an AI supporting this process, what does it do well? What does it not try to do?**\n\nA: It asks good questions, helps me see my own patterns, remembers what I said before, and occasionally offers a frame or challenge. It doesn't try to tell me what to think, doesn't overwhelm me with information, and doesn't push me faster than I want to go.\n\n---\n\n### 8. Synthesis and Next Steps\n\n**Summary of what I'm hearing:**\n\nThe core project is externalizing your therapeutic worldview so you can examine, test, and develop it. The key challenges are:\n1. **Extraction** - surfacing tacit knowledge through the right kind of questions\n2. **Structure** - organizing it in a way that makes connections visible\n3. **Engagement** - keeping it interesting with variety and visible progress\n4. **Tolerance of uncertainty** - flagging gaps and contradictions without forcing resolution\n\nThe process should:\n- Start from what you already believe (not from research)\n- Use specific, scenario-based questions\n- Include variety: Socratic dialogue, visual mapping, definition-building, gentle challenges\n- Have clear re-entry points\n- Integrate research selectively, not as the primary driver\n\n**Potential structure:**\n- **Core domains** (your building blocks): neurodivergence, nervous system, systems/context, parts/multiplicity\n- **Meta theory** (how they connect): theory of change, theory of mind\n- **Applied knowledge** (separate but linked): what you actually do in sessions\n\n**Q: Does this feel like an accurate summary? What's missing or wrong?**\n\nA: Yeah that's pretty accurate. The one thing I'd add is that I want this to be FUN or at least engaging - I've tried to do serious self-examination before and it becomes a chore. If this feels like play or exploration I'll actually do it.\n\n**Q: What's the smallest useful starting point? If we were to begin actually building this, where would you want to start?**\n\nA: I think starting with one concept and developing it fully would be good - to test the process. Maybe something mid-level, not too huge like \"consciousness\" but not too small either. Something like \"the role of the therapeutic relationship\" or \"what makes a moment of change.\"\n</result>\n\nExcellent. I now have a complete understanding of the brain_explore project.

Start first content session\n\n---\n\n### Critical Files for Implementation\n\n- `/home/chris/dev/projects/codex/brain_explore/CLAUDE.md` - Core project instructions and session protocol\n- `/home/chris/dev/projects/codex/brain_explore/docs/plans/2025-11-29-therapy-framework-design.md` - Full design specification including templates and phases\n- `/home/chris/dev/projects/codex/brain_explore/progress-framework-project.md` - Current blockers and next steps for meta track\n- `/home/chris/dev/projects/codex/brain_explore/Therapy approach development.md` - Original requirements and Q&A that shaped the design"
