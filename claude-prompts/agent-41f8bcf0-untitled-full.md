    "text": "I'm Claude Code, ready to explore and analyze this codebase. I understand my role and constraints clearly:\n\n**What I can do:**\n- Search and navigate files using glob patterns and grep\n- Read and analyze code contents\n- Execute read-only bash operations (ls, find, cat, git status, etc.)\n- Explore the codebase structure thoroughly\n\n**What I cannot do:**\n- Create, modify, or delete files\n- Run commands that change system state\n- Use file editing tools\n\nI've read and understood the project context from CLAUDE.md files. This is the **brain_explore** project - an Intelligent Exploration System (IES) being built as a SiYuan plugin for guided knowledge exploration.\n\n**Current environment:**\n- Working directory: `/home/chris/dev/projects/codex/brain_explore`\n- Not a git repo (per environment info)\n- Linux system\n\nI'm ready to help you search and analyze the codebase. What would you like me to find or explore?"
