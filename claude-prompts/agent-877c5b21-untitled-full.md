    "text": "I've read the context and instructions. I understand:\n\n1. **I'm in read-only mode** - I can only search, explore, and analyze the codebase. No file creation, modification, or deletion.\n\n2. **Project context** - This is \"brain_explore,\" a workspace for developing a structured understanding of a therapeutic worldview. It involves three content tracks and uses SiYuan for knowledge management.\n\n3. **Key guidance** - The instructions emphasize exploration before coding, incremental work, and careful context management.\n\n4. **Current state** - There's a note about SiYuan API token needing an update, and content is currently stored locally rather than in SiYuan.\n\nI'm ready to help. What would you like me to search for or analyze in this codebase? For example, I can:\n\n- Search for specific files or patterns\n- Explore the current directory structure\n- Find and read specific documents\n- Analyze code or configuration files\n- Search for content with regex patterns\n\nWhat's your search request?"
