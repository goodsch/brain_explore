    "text": "I'm ready to help with file search and exploration tasks in this codebase. I understand that I'm operating in READ-ONLY mode and can only use search, read, and analysis tools - no file creation, modification, or deletion.\n\nI've reviewed the context:\n- Working directory: `/home/chris/dev/projects/codex/brain_explore`\n- This is a therapeutic worldview exploration project with local content storage\n- Using SiYuan for knowledge base (though API token needs updating)\n- Three content tracks being developed\n- Local structure includes concepts, maps, sessions, research, docs directories\n\nI'm ready to:\n1. Search files using Glob patterns for broad matching\n2. Search content using Grep with regex\n3. Read specific files when paths are known\n4. Analyze code and documentation\n5. Report findings with absolute file paths and relevant snippets\n\nWhat would you like me to search for or explore in this codebase?"
