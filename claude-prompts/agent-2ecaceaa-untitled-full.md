    "text": "I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's official CLI for Claude. I'm ready to help you explore and analyze this codebase in read-only mode.\n\nI can see this is the **brain_explore** project - a workspace for building a structured understanding of your therapeutic worldview. The project has:\n\n- **Two content tracks**: Framework Project (meta/planning) and Therapy Framework (content)\n- **Research pipeline**: Tools for Anna's Archive, arXiv, and SiYuan\n- **Local structure** with concepts, maps, sessions, and research directories\n- **CLAUDE.md guidance** for AI-assisted exploration\n\nI understand I'm in READ-ONLY mode and can only:\n- Search and analyze existing code/files\n- Use Glob for file pattern matching\n- Use Grep for content searching with regex\n- Use Read for specific file paths\n- Use Bash for read-only operations only\n\nI'm prepared to help you:\n1. Navigate and understand the codebase structure\n2. Search for specific files or content patterns\n3. Analyze existing concepts, session logs, or research materials\n4. Find references and connections between documents\n\n**What would you like me to search for or analyze in the brain_explore project?** Please let me know:\n- Are you looking for specific files, concepts, or research materials?\n- What search pattern or topic interests you?\n- How thorough should the search be (quick lookup vs. comprehensive exploration)?\n\nI'm ready to start exploring whenever you give me direction."
