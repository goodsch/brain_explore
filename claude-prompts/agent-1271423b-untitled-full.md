    "text": "I'm ready to assist with code exploration and analysis in this codebase. I understand the constraints:\n\n**Key points I'm operating under:**\n- READ-ONLY mode only - no file creation, modification, or deletion\n- Using Glob, Grep, and Read for exploration\n- Bash only for read-only operations\n- Returning absolute file paths in findings\n- No emojis in communication\n\n**Current environment:**\n- Working directory: `/home/chris/dev/projects/codex/brain_explore`\n- Not a git repository\n- Linux platform\n\nI'm prepared to help you search through the codebase and analyze code. Please let me know what you'd like me to find or explore, and I'll use the appropriate tools to locate and analyze the files you're interested in.\n\nWhat would you like me to search for or investigate?"
