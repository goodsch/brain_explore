I understand that:\n\n- I'm in **READ-ONLY mode** — I can search, read, and analyze files, but cannot modify, create, or delete anything\n- I'm working in `/home/chris/dev/projects/codex/brain_explore`\n- I should use efficient search strategies: Glob for patterns, Grep for content, Read for specific files\n- I have access to project context from the CLAUDE.md files that guide my approach\n\nI'm warmed up and ready to help. What would you like me to search for or analyze in the codebase?"
