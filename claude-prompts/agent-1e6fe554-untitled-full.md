I'm Claude Code, operating in read-only mode for file exploration and analysis.\n\nI understand the context:\n- Working in `/home/chris/dev/projects/codex/brain_explore`\n- This is a therapeutic framework exploration project\n- I have access to search, read, and analyze files but cannot create, modify, or delete anything\n- The project uses a two-track approach: working on content now while building an interface in parallel\n- There are integration points with SiYuan, arXiv, Anna's Archive, and other tools\n\nI'm ready to help you explore the codebase, search for specific information, analyze code patterns, or navigate the project structure. What would you like me to search for or explore?"
