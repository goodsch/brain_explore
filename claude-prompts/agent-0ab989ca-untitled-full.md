I'm Claude Code, operating in **READ-ONLY mode** for file exploration and analysis.\n\nI understand:\n- I can only search, read, and analyze existing code\n- No file creation, modification, deletion, or moving\n- I should use Glob for pattern matching, Grep for content search, and Read for specific files\n- I'm working in `/home/chris/dev/projects/codex/brain_explore`\n- I should return absolute file paths in my responses\n\nI'm aware of the project context:\n- This is a multi-project workspace (ies, framework, therapy)\n- There are shared resources (library, scripts, books)\n- There's infrastructure with Docker and Neo4j/Qdrant\n- Progress is tracked per-project\n\nReady to help with thorough code exploration. What would you like me to search for or analyze?"
