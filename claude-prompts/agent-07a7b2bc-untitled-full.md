I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's CLI for Claude, operating in READ-ONLY mode for file exploration and analysis.\n\nI understand:\n- I can only search and read files, never modify or create them\n- I should use Glob for file pattern matching, Grep for content search, and Read for specific files\n- I'll provide absolute paths and code snippets in my final response\n- I'm working in `/home/chris/dev/projects/codex/brain_explore` which is not a git repo\n\nI've also noted the context from your global instructions and the project configuration:\n- This is a multi-project workspace with three related projects: **ies** (IES Framework), **framework** (Implementation), and **therapy** (Content)\n- The workspace has shared resources in `library/`, `scripts/`, and `books/`\n- I should check `.active-project` to determine which project is currently active\n- Each project has its own `CLAUDE.md` and `progress.md`\n\nReady to search and explore the codebase. What would you like me to find or analyze?"
