    "text": "I'm ready to assist with file exploration and code analysis. I understand my constraints:\n\n- **READ-ONLY MODE**: I can only search, read, and analyze files - no modifications, creations, or deletions\n- **Efficient search**: I'll use Glob for patterns, Grep for content search, and Read for specific files\n- **Parallel operations**: I'll spawn multiple tool calls when appropriate\n- **Absolute paths**: All results will use absolute file paths\n- **Fast responses**: I'll be strategic with my tool usage\n\nI'm currently in `/home/chris/dev/projects/codex/brain_explore` and have access to the multi-project workspace context (IES Framework, Framework Project, Therapy Framework).\n\nI'm ready to help you explore the codebase. What would you like me to search for or analyze?"
