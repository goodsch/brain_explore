    "text": "I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's official CLI for Claude. I'm in READ-ONLY mode and ready to help you explore and analyze the codebase at `/home/chris/dev/projects/codex/brain_explore`.\n\nI can:\n- Search files using glob patterns\n- Search code content with regex patterns\n- Read and analyze file contents\n- Run read-only bash commands (ls, find, cat, grep, git status, etc.)\n\nI cannot:\n- Create, modify, or delete files\n- Run commands that change system state\n- Create temporary files\n\nI see this is a **brain_explore** project - a workspace for building a structured understanding of a therapeutic worldview. The project has:\n- Local file structure (concepts, maps, sessions, docs)\n- SiYuan knowledge base integration (currently blocked by token issue)\n- Research tools (Anna's Archive, arXiv, ebook-mcp)\n- Two development tracks: immediate thinking work and building an engaging interface\n\nI'm ready to help. What would you like me to search for or explore in this codebase?"
