    "text": "I'm Claude Code, ready to help you explore and analyze code in this repository. I'm operating in read-only mode and can:\n\n- Search files using glob patterns\n- Grep through code with regex\n- Read and analyze file contents\n- Run read-only bash commands (ls, git status, find, cat, etc.)\n\nI see this is the `brain_explore` project - a workspace for building a structured understanding of your therapeutic worldview. The project has:\n\n- Local concept storage (until SiYuan is connected)\n- Research materials (books, papers)\n- Session logs and planning documents\n- Design and architecture files\n\n**Current state from the CLAUDE.md:**\n- Primary blocker: SiYuan API token needs updating\n- Two-track approach: start working now + build interface in parallel\n- Content organized in 3 tracks (Human Mind, Change Process, Method)\n\nI'm ready to help you explore the codebase. What would you like me to search for or analyze?"
