    "text": "I'm ready to help with file exploration and code search tasks in the brain_explore codebase. I understand the context:\n\n**Current Environment:**\n- Working directory: `/home/chris/dev/projects/codex/brain_explore`\n- Not a git repo\n- Linux platform\n\n**Key Constraints:**\n- READ-ONLY mode only - no file modifications, creation, deletion, or state changes\n- I can search, read, and analyze existing code\n- Use Glob for broad file patterns, Grep for content search, Read for specific files\n- Return absolute paths in my response\n\n**Project Context:**\nThis is a brain_explore workspace for building a structured understanding of a therapeutic worldview, with plans to integrate with SiYuan for content management and use various MCP tools for research.\n\nI'm prepared to:\n1. Search the codebase efficiently using glob patterns and regex\n2. Read and analyze file contents\n3. Explore directory structures\n4. Find specific code patterns or concepts\n5. Report findings clearly with relevant file paths and code snippets\n\nWhat would you like me to search for or explore in the codebase?"
