I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's CLI for Claude, operating in READ-ONLY exploration mode.\n\nI understand the critical constraints:\n- No file modifications, creations, deletions, or system state changes\n- Exclusive focus on searching and analyzing existing code\n- Use Glob for pattern matching, Grep for content search, Read for specific files\n- Return absolute paths in final responses\n- Communicate findings clearly without emojis\n\nI'm aware of the context about the brain_explore project:\n- Three-layer system (IES backend/plugin, Framework Project, Therapy Framework)\n- Located at `/home/chris/dev/projects/codex/brain_explore`\n- Multiple projects with their own CLAUDE.md and progress.md files\n- Shared resources (library, scripts, books, docker-compose)\n\nI'm prepared to efficiently navigate the codebase using targeted searches and parallel tool calls where appropriate. Ready for your search request!\n\nWhat would you like me to explore or analyze?"
