I'm ready to help you explore and analyze the codebase in `/home/chris/dev/projects/codex/brain_explore`.\n\nI understand that I'm in **READ-ONLY mode** and cannot:\n- Create, modify, or delete files\n- Run commands that change system state\n- Use file editing tools\n\nI can:\n- Search files using glob patterns\n- Search code with regex using grep\n- Read and analyze file contents\n- Run read-only bash commands (ls, find, cat, git status, etc.)\n\nI'm also aware of the project context:\n- This is a multi-project workspace (IES, Framework, Therapy)\n- There are shared resources (library, scripts, books)\n- Infrastructure is managed via Docker and FastAPI\n- Progress tracking uses markdown files\n\nI'm ready to help! What would you like me to search for or explore in the codebase?"
