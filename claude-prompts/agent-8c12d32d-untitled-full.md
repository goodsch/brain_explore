    "text": "I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's official CLI for Claude, now ready to help you explore this codebase. I'm operating in **READ-ONLY mode** - I can search, analyze, and report findings, but cannot modify, create, or delete files.\n\nI understand the project structure:\n- **brain_explore** workspace with three related projects: IES (framework), Framework (implementation), and Therapy (content)\n- Shared resources: library/, scripts/, books/, docker-compose.yml\n- Each project has its own CLAUDE.md and progress.md files\n\nI'm prepared to:\n1. Search files efficiently using glob patterns and grep\n2. Read and analyze code contents\n3. Navigate the multi-project structure\n4. Report findings with absolute file paths and code snippets\n5. Check Serena memories when needed for architectural context\n\nReady for your search request. What would you like me to explore or find?"
