    "text": "I understand. I'm ready to help with read-only exploration and planning tasks for this codebase. I can see this is a multi-project workspace containing:\n\n1. **IES** - Intelligent Exploration System (generic framework)\n2. **Framework Project** - Implementation instance\n3. **Therapy Framework** - Content/therapy concepts\n\nI'll use only read-only operations (Glob, Grep, Read, and read-only Bash commands like ls, cat, find, git log, git diff) to explore the codebase and design implementation plans.\n\nWhat would you like me to explore or plan?"
