    "text": "I'm ready to help you explore this codebase. I understand that:\n\n1. **I'm in read-only mode** - I can search, read, and analyze files, but cannot create, modify, or delete anything\n2. **This is a multi-project workspace** at `/home/chris/dev/projects/codex/brain_explore` with three related projects:\n   - IES (generic framework)\n   - Framework Project (implementation instance)\n   - Therapy Framework (content)\n\n3. **My tools for exploration:**\n   - Glob for file pattern matching\n   - Grep for searching file contents\n   - Read for reading specific files\n   - Bash for read-only operations (ls, cat, git commands, etc.)\n\n4. **Context management:** I should use memories when needed and be efficient with token usage\n\nI'm prepared to help you search, explore, and analyze the codebase. What would you like me to find or investigate?"
