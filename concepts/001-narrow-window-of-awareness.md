## Core Statement
Humans exist in a narrow window of awareness — aware enough to create meaning, beliefs, and "knowledge" from limited sensory data, but not aware enough to see our own blind spots. This limitation is simultaneously the source of our suffering AND our unique capacity to experience meaning, beauty, love, and purpose.

## Why I Believe This

### From Experience
Clients often suffer not from reality itself, but from meaning they've constructed about reality without knowing they constructed it. Yet stripping away all meaning doesn't heal — it empties. The goal isn't "more correct" but "less unnecessarily painful."

### From Intuition
A more advanced intelligence might see us as maximally inefficient — evolved enough to fight wars over skin color, not evolved enough to see the absurdity. But they'd also miss what we have: the experience of meaning itself.

### From Evidence
[TO RESEARCH: Predictive processing, meaning-making in psychology, existentialist philosophy on meaning]

## The Paradox
- Lower organisms: More efficient, less suffering, but no access to meaning
- Higher intelligence: More correct, but meaning becomes epiphenomenal
- Humans: Inefficient, often wrong, but uniquely positioned to EXPERIENCE meaning
- The ignorant creation of "false" meaning IS meaning — our incorrectness is correctness

## Therapeutic Implications
1. **Not about widening awareness universally** — some narrowness is feature, not bug
2. **Recognize unnecessary pain** — beliefs that cause suffering and CAN be revised
3. **Allow unique contribution** — even when not "the norm"
4. **Validate all paths** — mediocrity, mountain climbing, all of it matters
5. **People matter simply because** — no justification needed

## Open Questions
- [ ] How do we distinguish necessary vs. unnecessary pain?
- [ ] What makes some meaning-making "inaccurate enough to cause suffering"?
- [ ] Where does neurodivergence fit — different window, not narrower/wider?
- [ ] How does the nervous system interact with meaning-making?

## Related Concepts
- [[Meaning as Solution]] - meaning-making is adaptive, not pathological
- [[Unique Personhood]] - the brain creates a singular person who matters
- [[Unnecessary Pain]] - the clinical target (vs. unavoidable suffering)
- [[Efficiency vs. Experience]] - the tradeoff between correctness and meaning
