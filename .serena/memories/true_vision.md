# True Vision: Meta-Cognitive Exploration System

**Core Vision:**
Help people understand *how they think* and *how they see the world* so they can achieve meaningful change.

## Three Interconnected Capabilities

**1. Flow Mode** — Non-linear knowledge navigation with AI documentation
- Start anywhere in knowledge graph, follow threads of interest
- AI documents exploration path and connections made
- Solves: Linear reading doesn't match natural association patterns

**2. Thinking Pattern Identification** — Recognize cognitive patterns through observation
- System observes where you navigate, what you connect, how you think
- Builds profile of unique thinking style
- Solves: People don't recognize their own thinking patterns

**3. Therapeutic Dialogue** — Adaptive questioning based on identified patterns
- Questions adapt to how you think, not generic prompts
- Creates insight through understanding unique perspective
- Solves: Generic questions ignore individual cognitive styles

## Why This Works

These three layers reinforce each other:
```
Flow Mode reveals patterns
    ↓
Patterns inform dialogue
    ↓
Dialogue surfaces concepts
    ↓
Concepts expand knowledge graph
    ↓
Knowledge graph enables deeper flow
    ↓ (cycle continues)
```

## The Core Insight

**You can't ask the right questions until you understand how someone processes information.**

Traditional therapy assumes:
- Therapist knows what to ask
- Client can articulate experience
- Linear conversation reveals truth

This model recognizes:
- Questions must match cognitive style
- Expression varies by processing mode
- Non-linear exploration follows natural thinking

## Current Implementation

**brain_explore** focuses on therapeutic worldview exploration:
- IES backend: Production-ready (4,496 lines Python, 61 tests)
- Neo4j: 48,987 entities from psychology/therapy books
- Status: Phase 0 (config stabilization) → Phase 1 (prove it works)
