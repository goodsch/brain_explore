# Phased Recovery Path: Phases 0-5

**Strategy:** Prove core value first, then expand systematically. No generalization until proven useful in one domain.

## Phase 0: Configuration Stabilization (2-3 days)

**Goal:** Remove activation friction, establish sustainable config

**Actions:**
- ✅ Initialize git repository
- ✅ Consolidate CLAUDE.md (4 → 1 file, 459 → 150 lines)
- ✅ Archive progress files (use git history instead)
- ✅ Delete active-project system
- ✅ Consolidate Serena memories (11 → 4)
- ✅ Create parking lot for future features

**Success Criteria:**
- Single CLAUDE.md is source of truth
- Configuration overhead: 40% → <5%
- Ready to begin actual work

## Phase 1: Prove Core Hypothesis (2-3 weeks)

**Goal:** Validate that IES actually works for therapy exploration

**Actions:**
- Build minimum viable SiYuan plugin interface
- Create user profile (Chris's thinking patterns)
- Run 5+ therapy exploration sessions
- Extract entities, create concepts, build connections
- Document what works/doesn't work

**Success Criteria:**
- 20-30 therapy concepts developed
- Entities extracted and connected
- Clear evidence system captures thinking patterns
- Decision point: Proceed to Phase 2 or pivot?

**Deliverables:**
- Working SiYuan plugin sidebar
- Personal profile populated
- Exploration sessions documented
- Validation that core vision works

## Phase 2: Build Core Workflow (3-4 weeks)

**Goal:** Make the system reliable and comfortable to use daily

**Actions:**
- Refine plugin based on Phase 1 learnings
- Add keyboard shortcuts and workflow optimizations
- Improve entity extraction quality
- Build session protocol that feels natural
- Document patterns that emerge

**Success Criteria:**
- Daily use feels effortless
- 50+ concepts developed
- Clear therapy framework emerging
- System adds value, not friction

## Phase 3: Develop Content Depth (4-6 weeks)

**Goal:** Build out therapy framework comprehensively

**Actions:**
- Develop Track 1 (Human Mind) concepts
- Develop Track 2 (Change Process) concepts
- Develop Track 3 (Method) concepts
- Create connections between concepts
- Document clinical applications

**Success Criteria:**
- 100+ concepts across three tracks
- Rich concept network developed
- Therapeutic worldview articulated
- Framework useful for clinical thinking

## Phase 4: Add Flow Mode (4-6 weeks)

**Goal:** Enable non-linear reading with AI documentation

**Actions:**
- Build PDF reading interface
- Implement graph navigation
- Add AI path documentation
- Connect reading to concept creation
- Test with psychology/therapy books

**Success Criteria:**
- Can read non-linearly through book collection
- AI documents exploration paths accurately
- Reading sessions create new concepts
- Flow Mode proves valuable for learning

## Phase 5: Generalize (Only If Demanded)

**Goal:** Make system work for other domains (only if Phase 1-4 successful)

**Actions:**
- Extract domain-agnostic components
- Create configuration system for domains
- Build 2nd domain implementation (test generalization)
- Port salvageable Synapse components

**Success Criteria:**
- Core system works in 2+ domains
- Generalization doesn't break therapy use case
- Clear value from generalization
- Other people actually want to use it

## The Discipline

**Rules:**
1. No skipping phases
2. No parallel phase work
3. No "quick additions" from later phases
4. Parking lot for all expansion ideas
5. Each phase proves value before next begins

**Why This Works:**
- Validates assumptions early
- Prevents abandonment trajectory
- Creates real value at each stage
- Builds on proven foundation
- Allows course correction

## Current Status

**Phase 0:** Complete (Configuration stabilization done)
**Phase 1:** Ready to begin (Prove core hypothesis)

**Next Session:**
- Build minimum viable SiYuan plugin interface
- Create Chris's user profile
- Run first therapy exploration session
