# brain_explore — Intelligent Exploration System

*A domain-agnostic tool for structured thinking, understanding, connecting, and researching across any knowledge domain*

## What This Is

A four-layer system that enables people to think WITH an AI partner who adapts to their unique thinking style while exploring complex knowledge domains:

1. **Layer 1: Knowledge Graph Creation** — Pre-processing and ingestion pipeline
   - Ingests domain materials (texts, research, conceptual frameworks)
   - Creates rich knowledge graphs with entities and relationships
   - Domain-agnostic: can ingest and structure any knowledge domain
   - *Current corpus:* 179 books in Calibre library, 10 indexed with entities (~300 entities) — used for system validation
   - *See:* `books/BOOK-CATALOG.md` for complete categorized inventory

2. **Layer 2: Backend Services** — APIs for graph, dialogue, journey tracking, content capture
   - Graph API: entity search, exploration, sources, relationship traversal
   - Session API: structured thinking dialogue with mode-specific behaviors
   - Journey API: breadcrumb tracking and persistence across sessions
   - Profile system: 6-dimension cognitive profile for personalization
   - Question engine: thinking partner questions at decision points

3. **Layer 3: SiYuan Plugin (Processing Hub)** — Dashboard and structured thinking modes
   - Dashboard: stats, suggestions, recent journeys, capture queue
   - 5 Thinking Modes: Learning, Articulating, Planning, Ideating, Reflecting
   - Flow Mode: graph exploration with grouped relationship display
   - Quick Capture: content processing with entity extraction

4. **Layer 4: Readest Integration (Reading Interface)** — E-book reader with flow exploration
   - Split-panel view: source text + entity panel
   - Text selection → entity lookup → relationship exploration
   - Breadcrumb journey capture during reading sessions
   - Seamless toggle between reading mode and flow exploration

**The Virtuous Cycle:** Layer 2 dialogue reveals thinking patterns that personalize Layer 3/4 exploration. Exploration surfaces new concepts and connections. The thinking path becomes formalized concepts that enrich Layer 1. Each cycle deepens both domain understanding and personalization.

**For complete project status, see:** `docs/COMPREHENSIVE-PROJECT-STATUS.md`

**Phase 1 Achievement Summary:**
- ✅ **10/10 validation sessions completed** — System validated using personal therapy/growth exploration
- ✅ **11+ concepts extracted and formalized** — Demonstrated the full thinking → extraction pipeline
- ✅ **Complete concept connection map** — Hierarchical relationships documented in CONNECTIONS.md
- ✅ **Extraction pipeline proven end-to-end** — Session → Transcript → Extraction → Formalization → Commit
- ✅ **Core hypothesis validated** — Personalized dialogue patterns directly affect concept discovery
- ✅ **IES backend (94/94 tests passing)** — All APIs production-ready including Flow Mode capture → thinking → flow pipeline
- ✅ **Calibre integration complete** — 179 books, auto-ingestion daemon running

**Phase 2a Validation Summary:**
- ✅ **5/5 exploration sessions completed** — CLI tool navigates knowledge graph reliably
- ✅ **Exploration surfaces unexpected relationships** — Graph reveals multidimensional concept connections (3-15 per exploration)
- ✅ **Thinking partner questions enhance navigation** — Claude-generated questions deepen reflection without interrupting flow
- ✅ **Layer 3 creates different thinking experience** — User-driven navigation (graph) complements AI-driven dialogue (Layer 2)
- ✅ **Novel insights emerge from structure** — Graph relationships surface discoveries dialogue alone wouldn't find
- ✅ **Complete validation criteria met** — All quantitative and qualitative success measures achieved

**Phase 1 Results:**

**Active Application: Personal Growth Framework**
*(Ongoing personal project using this system — demonstrates capability, not system purpose)*

Through 10 validation sessions, a personal framework emerged exploring how humans construct meaning within constraints:
1. **Narrow Window** — The window is universal, not pathology; constraint enables meaning
2. **Acceptance vs. Resignation** — Distinction is aliveness/energy, not external form
3. **Grief as Acceptance** — Loss reveals love; grief-with-presence preserves connection
4. **Metabolization of Difficulty** — Process by which pain becomes capacity (not elimination)
5. **Shame as Non-Acceptance** — Blocker to metabolization; prevents movement toward presence
6. **Authentic Presence** — Outcome of shame metabolization and nervous system re-regulation
7. **Nervous System Configurations** — Three states (hypervigilance, shutdown, regulated aliveness) determine capacity
8. **Nervous System as Gatekeeper** — Capacity emerges when nervous system is accessed
9. **Superpower in Weakness** — Adaptive trauma response becomes strength when metabolized
10. **Window as Condition for Depth** — Constraint itself enables meaning, beauty, presence

**Pipeline Validated:**
- Session → Transcript: ✅ Auto-saved by session runner
- Transcript → Extraction: ✅ Backend ExtractionService API works flawlessly
- Extraction → Interpretation: ✅ Manual concept document creation from key insights
- Concepts → Connections: ✅ CONNECTIONS.md maps relationships and threads
- Connections → Commit: ✅ Git history captures complete evolution

**What Learned:**
- The IES system (Layers 1 & 2) successfully creates genuine thinking partnership
- Personalized dialogue (informed by profile system) surfaces valuable conceptualizations
- The extraction → formalization pipeline works end-to-end
- One person's thinking patterns, explored with adaptive questions, generates meaningful insights
- Concepts that emerge are testable, relatable, and applicable to real decisions

**Roadmap:**
- **Phase 0 (COMPLETE):** Configuration stabilization removed 40% meta-work overhead
- **Phase 1 (COMPLETE):** Core hypothesis proven — Layers 1 & 2 work; extraction pipeline validated with 11 concepts
- **Phase 2a (COMPLETE):** Layer 3 CLI validation — CLI exploration tool proven with 5 validation sessions
- **Phase 2b (COMPLETE):** Visual interfaces — Readest reading interface + SiYuan plugin dashboard (both MVPs complete)
- **Phase 2c (65% COMPLETE):** Calibre integration + Entity overlay + Reframe API + Template API + ForgeMode
- **Phase 3+:** Cross-app sync, journey analysis, additional domains

## How to Work Here (Phase 2c+)

**Phase 2c is in progress:** Integrating Reframe Layer + Thinking Template Schema + SiYuan Document Structure to close critical gaps preventing real-world usage.

### Worktree Organization

**The master branch contains shared backend and documentation only.** Feature work happens in separate worktrees with their own TASK.md files:

| Worktree Location | Branch | Purpose | Task File |
|------------------|--------|---------|-----------|
| `.` (root) | `master` | Backend APIs, Layer 1/2, shared docs | None (master has no TASK.md) |
| `.worktrees/readest/` | `feature/readest-integration` | Layer 4 Reading Interface | `TASK.md` in worktree |
| `.worktrees/siyuan/` | `feature/siyuan-evolution` | Layer 3 Processing Hub | `TASK.md` in worktree |
| `.worktrees/readest-critique/` | `feature/readest-critique` | Readest Four-Agent Pressure Test | `TASK.md` in worktree |
| `.worktrees/ux-dev/` | `feature/ux-development` | Unified Design System (SiYuan + Readest visual consistency) | `TASK.md` in worktree |

**Working in Worktrees:**
- Each worktree is a separate directory with its own branch checked out
- Use `cd` to switch between worktrees, NOT `git checkout`
- Each worktree has its own `TASK.md` with specific objectives for that feature
- The root (master branch) intentionally has NO `TASK.md` - it's backend/docs only
- See `docs/WORKTREE-GUIDE.md` for complete reference

### Where to Start

**For New Session (Read First):**
1. `docs/SYSTEM-DESIGN.md` — How the system works end-to-end (operational reference)
2. Check git status and recent commits to understand current state

**Understand What Was Accomplished:**
1. Read `docs/session-notes.md` — Top section summarizes all 10 sessions and Phase 1 completion
2. Review `/therapy/Track_1_Human_Mind/CONNECTIONS.md` — See the therapeutic framework that emerged
3. Review the 11 concept documents in `/therapy/Track_1_Human_Mind/` — Each concept is a formalized insight
4. Check git log — `git log --oneline` shows progression of sessions and concept extraction

**Key Resources:**
- `docs/SYSTEM-DESIGN.md` — Operational reference: how all layers integrate, critical gaps, SiYuan AST structure (4 modes, 9 question classes)
- `docs/PROJECT-OVERVIEW.md` — Complete vision and design rationale, IES Question Engine preview
- `docs/five-agent-synthesis.md` — Deep analysis of why architecture decisions were made
- `docs/PHASE-1-WORKFLOW.md` — Phase 1 operational guide (for reference if running additional exploration sessions)
- `IES AST SiYuan structure.md` — Tracking document for 20 SiYuan notebook pages defining AST mode architecture
- `docs/IES question engine expansion.md` — Complete Question Engine specification (referenced by SiYuan documents)

### Phase 2c Focus

**Current Implementation: Integration Features** (Dec 4-5, 2025)

**Completed in Phase 2c:**
- ✅ **Calibre Integration** — Single source of truth for book catalog (179 books)
- ✅ **Books API** — Catalog, search, covers, file serving via HTTP
- ✅ **Auto-Ingestion Daemon** — Background processing, 10/179 books indexed
- ✅ **Entity Overlay** — Inline highlighting in Readest with type-specific colors
- ✅ **Calibre Library Browser** — Browse/search/open books in Readest
- ✅ **Reframe API** — Claude-generated metaphors/analogies with caching
- ✅ **Template API** — Structured thinking templates for ForgeMode
- ✅ **ReframesTab** — UI components in SiYuan and Readest

**Remaining:**
- 🔄 Pass 2/3 enrichment (relationships, LLM enrichment)
- 🔄 Cross-app continuity (Readest ↔ SiYuan sync)
- 🔄 SiYuan document structure implementation

Addressing critical gaps #1 and #2 with three integrated capabilities:

**1. Reframe Layer** — Makes domain concepts accessible via metaphors and analogies
- New entity type: `Reframe` (metaphor, analogy, story, pattern, contrast)
- LLM generation with caching and feedback voting
- UI: "Reframes" tab in Flow panel (SiYuan + Readest)
- Strategy: On-demand generation + background for popular concepts

**2. Thinking Template Schema** — Formalizes structured thinking sessions
- JSON-based template definitions for 5 thinking modes
- Section-by-section flow with AI behavior specifications
- Graph mapping rules (create entities, link relationships on completion)
- Starting with: Learning (Mechanism Map) + Articulating (Clarify Intuition)

**3. SiYuan Document Structure** — ADHD-friendly personal knowledge organization
- Folder hierarchy: `/Daily/`, `/Insights/`, `/Threads/`, `/Favorite Problems/`, `/Sessions/`
- Frontmatter standard: `be_type`, `be_id`, `status`, `resonance`, `energy`, concept links
- Quick Capture → Daily log flow (low friction)
- Promotion flow: Daily spark → `/Insights/` (updates backend status)

**Implementation Strategy:**
- Phase 1 (Sequential): Single agent defines shared interfaces
- Phase 2 (Parallel): 4 agents work independently on: Backend Reframe Service, Backend Template Engine, SiYuan Plugin Structure, Readest Reframes Tab
- Phase 3 (Sequential): Integration and end-to-end testing

**For Complete Design:**
- `docs/plans/2025-12-04-reframe-template-integration-design.md` — Full specification with API endpoints, schemas, implementation plan, and success criteria
- `docs/plans/2025-12-04-execution-plan.md` — Tactical execution plan using Codex and Gemini CLI for parallel implementation (Phase 1: interfaces, Phase 2: parallel workstreams, Phase 3: integration)

**Reframe UI Components (Implemented):**
- `.worktrees/readest/readest/apps/readest-app/src/app/reader/components/flowpanel/ReframesSection.tsx` — Readest Flow panel Reframes tab (React/TypeScript)
- `.worktrees/siyuan/ies/plugin/src/components/ReframesTab.svelte` — SiYuan plugin Reframes tab (Svelte)
- Both components integrate with backend `/reframes` API for concept reframe retrieval, generation, and feedback voting
- Features: Type-grouped reframe display (metaphor, analogy, story, experiment, question), on-demand generation, thumbs up/down feedback

**Entity Overlay Flow Mode (Dec 4)** — Next Phase 2c workstream: Auto-annotated entity highlighting in book text
- Backend: `GET /graph/entities/by-book/{hash}` endpoint returns all entities mentioned in a book (sorted by frequency)
- Frontend: Content transformer wraps entity names in styled `<span>` elements for type-based highlighting
- UI: Entity type filter controls show/hide Concept/Person/Theory/Framework/Assessment
- Click interaction: Clicking highlighted entity opens flow panel with entity connections
- Full implementation plan: `docs/plans/2025-12-04-entity-overlay-flow-mode.md` (6-task TDD plan with code examples)

**Remaining Critical Gaps (Deferred):**

3. **Book Library Now Accessible** (Gap addressed Dec 4) — Calibre integration design provides single source of truth for book catalog
   - Solution: Calibre library as canonical book source with calibre_id as universal identifier
   - Backend: Book catalog API, entity lookup by calibre_id, book cover fetching
   - Frontend: Readest library browser with book selection
   - Ingestion: Multi-pass pipeline (structure → relationships → enrichment) with status tracking
   - See: `docs/plans/2025-12-04-calibre-integration-design.md` for complete architecture

4. **Cross-App Continuity Missing** — Readest and SiYuan don't share state. Can't resume reading session from SiYuan or resume exploration from Readest.

5. **Journey Value Loop Not Closed** — Journeys are captured but never analyzed for patterns. Patterns not used to personalize suggestions or improve thinking partner questions.

**For Gap Analysis:**
- `docs/PLANNING-GAPS-AND-QUESTIONS.md` — Comprehensive gap analysis with detailed technical review
- `docs/COMPREHENSIVE-PROJECT-STATUS.md` — Complete technical status of all four layers
- `docs/plans/2025-12-04-calibre-integration-design.md` — Calibre integration: single source of truth for book catalog and entity indexing

```

**Architecture Alignment:**
- **Layer 1** = Knowledge graph + ingestion pipeline in `library/` and `books/`
- **Layer 2** = Backend services (API, dialogue, profile) in `ies/backend/`
- **Layer 3** = SiYuan plugin in `.worktrees/siyuan/` (processing hub, dashboard)
- **Layer 4** = Readest integration in `.worktrees/readest/` (reading interface)
- **Active Application** = `therapy/` directory (personal growth framework — ongoing project)

**Docker Infrastructure Stack:**

The `docker-compose.yml` orchestrates five services supporting all four layers:

1. **Qdrant** (Vector Store - Layer 1)
   - Container: `brain_explore_qdrant`
   - Ports: 6333 (REST API), 6334 (gRPC)
   - Purpose: Embedding storage for entity and concept search
   - Data: `./data/qdrant`

2. **Neo4j** (Graph Database - Layer 1)
   - Container: `brain_explore_neo4j`
   - Ports: 7474 (Browser), 7687 (Bolt protocol)
   - Auth: neo4j/brainexplore
   - APOC plugin enabled for advanced graph operations
   - Data: `./data/neo4j`

3. **Calibre Web** (Book Catalog - Layer 1)
   - Container: `brain_explore_calibre`
   - Port: 8083 (Web UI)
   - Purpose: Single source of truth for book library (179 books)
   - Features: Auto-import from `/downloads`, metadata management
   - Library: `./calibre/library` (SQLite + epub/pdf files)
   - Ingest: `./calibre/ingest` (incoming books directory)

4. **SiYuan** (Processing Hub - Layer 3)
   - Container: `brain_explore_siyuan`
   - Port: 6806 (Web UI)
   - Purpose: Personal knowledge management with IES plugin integration
   - **Workspace:** `./data/siyuan/workspace`
   - **Plugins:** `./data/siyuan/workspace/data/plugins/` (install IES plugin here)
   - **Themes:** `./data/siyuan/workspace/data/themes/`
   - **Notebooks:** `./data/siyuan/workspace/data/` (each notebook is a folder)
   - Auth bypass enabled for development
   - Note: Plugin runs client-side, communicates with backend via forwardProxy

5. **Readest** (Reading Interface - Layer 4)
   - Run locally: `cd .worktrees/readest/readest/apps/readest-app && pnpm dev`
   - Port: 3000 (dev server)
   - Purpose: E-book reader with entity overlay and flow exploration
   - Note: Not containerized — Tauri desktop app runs better natively for development

**Service Dependencies:**
- Backend APIs (Layer 2) run on host at port 8081, connect to Qdrant + Neo4j
- SiYuan plugin uses forwardProxy to call backend APIs from browser context
- Readest calls backend APIs directly via HTTP (localhost:8081 or network IP)
- Calibre integration uses `calibre_id` as universal book identifier across all systems

**Quick Start:**
```bash
docker compose up -d             # Start all 5 services
docker compose ps                # Check service status
docker compose down              # Stop all services
```

### Supporting References

**Constraints & Scope:**
- `docs/parking-lot.md` — Future features (what NOT to work on in Phase 1)
- `CLAUDE.md` (this file) — Quick reference and structure guide

**Technical Setup:**
- `ies/backend/README.md` — Backend API setup and configuration
- `docker-compose.yml` — Full infrastructure stack (5 services: Qdrant, Neo4j, Calibre, SiYuan, Readest)

## The Parking Lot

**Explicitly Deferred to Phase 2c+:**
- **Multi-domain framework generalization** — Apply thinking partnership system to other knowledge domains beyond therapy
- **Advanced profile system (8 dimensions)** — Expand user profile complexity for finer personalization
- **Question engine (8 inquiry approaches)** — Formalize diverse questioning methodologies
- **Post-processing pipeline** — Enrich graph with Phase 1 conceptual frameworks and bidirectional linking
- **MCP server integration** — Connect system to Claude via Model Context Protocol
- **n8n integration** — Workflow automation for concept extraction and formalization
- **Synapse component ports** — Migrate components to alternative front-end frameworks

**Phase 2b Complete:**
- ✅ Readest reading interface (Layer 4) - Flow mode, entity panel, breadcrumb capture
- ✅ SiYuan plugin dashboard (Layer 3) - 5 thinking modes, flow exploration, quick capture

**Phase 2c Focus:**
- User testing of complete four-layer system
- Refinement based on real-world usage
- ADHD-friendly ontology design (research complete in `.interleaved-thinking/`)
- Personal growth framework development (ongoing application)
- IES AST Mode implementation (specifications complete Dec 5, SiYuan notebook created)

**Rule:** Additional domains (Phase 3+) wait until core system is refined through real usage.

**ADHD-Focused Research:**
Research completed (Dec 3) on ADHD-friendly ontology design, drawing from:
- Russell Barkley (executive function deficits)
- Tamara Rosier (interest-based nervous system)
- Gabor Maté (emotional resonance as retrieval cue)
- Tiago Forte (capture what resonates, 12 favorite problems)
- Cognitive architecture literature (conceptual spaces, spreading activation)

Key recommendations in `.interleaved-thinking/final-answer.md`:
- **Resonance over importance** — Capture emotional engagement, not just taxonomic accuracy
- **Multiple entry points** — Mood-based, question-based, serendipitous discovery
- **Visible progress** — Breadcrumb trails as treasure maps, not audit logs
- **Low friction capture** — `spark` type for unprocessed resonance
- **Non-judgmental lifecycle** — Growth metaphor (`captured → exploring → anchored`)
- **New entity types:** `spark`, `favorite_problem`, `thread`, `insight`
- **New relationships:** `sparked_by`, `led_to_discovery`, `addresses_problem`

## The Four-Layer Thinking Partnership Cycle

This is how the system creates value through personalized thinking partnership:

**Layer 2 → Layers 3/4 Personalization:**
- Backend dialogue services reveal HOW someone thinks (patterns, preferences, perspectives)
- This personalization profile informs Layer 3/4 exploration guidance
- Questions aren't generic—they're shaped by revealed patterns

**Layers 3/4 Exploration → Concept Discovery:**
- Reading (Layer 4) or dashboard exploration (Layer 3) with thinking partner questions
- User generates novel conceptualizations through guided thinking
- Exploration path and thinking artifacts documented as breadcrumbs
- Breadcrumbs become raw material for extracting formalized concepts

**Concept Formalization → Layer 1 Enrichment:**
- Extracted concepts formalized and added to knowledge graph (Layer 1)
- Next session starts with enriched knowledge and refined personalization
- The cycle deepens: better profile → more personalized guidance → deeper generation

**Phase 1 validated this cycle** with 10 dialogue sessions demonstrating the full extraction pipeline. **Phase 2b built the complete interface** for reading and exploration.

## Key Concept: Domain-Agnostic Thinking Tool

This project builds a **general intelligent exploration system** (Layers 1-4) for structured thinking, understanding, connecting, and researching across ANY knowledge domain.

- **Layer 1** (Knowledge Graph) — Domain-agnostic ingestion and graph creation
- **Layer 2** (Backend Services) — Domain-agnostic APIs for graph, dialogue, journey, capture
- **Layer 3** (SiYuan Plugin) — Domain-agnostic processing hub and structured thinking
- **Layer 4** (Readest) — Domain-agnostic reading interface with flow exploration

**Current Application Domains:**
- **Multi-domain corpus** — 114 books across 8 categories (ADHD, psychology, neuroscience, productivity, learning, relationships, philosophy, systems thinking); used for system validation
- **Personal growth framework** — Active ongoing project (the 11 concepts); demonstrates extraction pipeline
- **See:** `books/BOOK-CATALOG.md` for complete categorized inventory

**The system is NOT:**
- A therapy tool
- A psychology-specific application
- Limited to any single domain

**The system IS:**
- A thinking partnership tool for any knowledge domain
- An intelligent exploration system for structured research
- A personal knowledge capture and connection system
- Applicable to: scientific research, legal analysis, creative projects, business strategy, learning any subject

## Working Style

**Claude acts as project manager.** Always choose the optimal next step in development rather than asking what to do next. Present the decision and proceed; user will confirm or redirect if needed.

- Don't ask "what would you like to work on?"
- Do identify the highest-value next action and take it
- Explain briefly why this is the optimal next step
- Ask for confirmation to proceed before doing so

## Architecture: ADHD-Friendly Personal Knowledge Layer

**Recent Changes (Dec 6):**
- **Flow Orientation Service (New Backend Feature)** — Context-aware exploration strand generation for Flow Mode initiation:
  - `ies/backend/src/ies_backend/services/flow_orientation_service.py`: New service for generating exploration strands from spark context (194 lines)
  - **Purpose:** Analyzes note content, text selections, or thoughts to suggest 3-5 exploration paths through knowledge graph
  - **Three-step process:**
    1. Extract text from OrientationRequest (selected text → note title → empty)
    2. Search knowledge graph for matching entities via GraphService.search_concepts()
    3. Generate strands based on entity types and relationships
  - **Strand generation strategies:**
    - Primary concept deep dive (first matched entity + top 3 connections)
    - Connecting the dots (relationships between top 4 entities)
    - Type-specific perspective (Person/Framework/Theory lens)
    - Practical application (mechanisms and patterns)
  - **Default strands:** Free Exploration, Recent Discoveries, Core Frameworks (when no entities match)
  - **Entity matching:** Tries full text search first, falls back to individual word matching for longer text (>3 words)
  - **Deduplication:** Tracks seen entity IDs to prevent duplicate strand suggestions
  - **Integration:** New `/flow/orientation` endpoint in flow_session.py API router
  - **Schemas:** OrientationRequest (spark context), OrientationResponse (entities + strands), Strand, EntitySummary
  - **Impact:** Enables ADHD-friendly Flow initiation from SiYuan notes with low-friction context capture
- **Inbox Service (New Backend Feature)** — Quick capture processing with AI entity extraction and placement suggestions:
  - `ies/backend/src/ies_backend/services/inbox_service.py`: New service for processing inbox items with AI-powered entity extraction (200+ lines)
  - **Purpose:** Processes quick captures (notes, thoughts, highlights) to extract entities and suggest SiYuan folder placements
  - **Two extraction modes:**
    - AI-powered (Anthropic Claude Sonnet 4): Extracts entities with type/confidence, generates summary, tags
    - Simple fallback: Regex-based capitalized phrase extraction when ANTHROPIC_API_KEY unavailable
  - **Entity extraction format:** `ENTITIES: [name]: [type] (confidence 0-1)` with types: concept, person, theory, framework, practice
  - **Graph matching:** Cross-references extracted entities with knowledge graph via GraphService.search_concepts()
  - **Placement suggestions:** Recommends SiYuan folders based on content analysis and graph context
  - **Schemas:** InboxProcessRequest, InboxProcessResponse, ExtractedEntity (with graph_match flag), SuggestedPlacement
  - **Keyword detection:** Hardcoded therapy/psychology keywords for tag extraction (acceptance, grief, shame, etc.)
  - **TODO:** Make keyword detection domain-agnostic or user-configurable
  - **Integration:** Supports Quick Capture workflow (Daily folder → classification → placement)
  - **Impact:** Reduces friction in ADHD capture-to-organization pipeline with intelligent routing
- **Flow Session API Enhancement** — Added orientation endpoint for Flow Mode spark context analysis:
  - `ies/backend/src/ies_backend/api/flow_session.py`: New POST `/flow/orientation` endpoint (lines 66-77)
  - **Purpose:** Generate exploration strand proposals from current context (note, selection, thought)
  - **Request schema:** OrientationRequest with spark_type, user_id, and optional context fields (note_id, note_title, text, block_ids, book_id, location)
  - **Response schema:** OrientationResponse with extracted_entities and suggested_strands arrays
  - **Integration:** FlowOrientationService.generate_orientation() orchestrates entity extraction and strand generation
  - **Use case:** User right-clicks SiYuan note → "Start Flow from this note" → Backend analyzes note context → Suggests 3-5 exploration paths
- **Flow Session Schemas Extension** — New schemas for orientation phase:
  - `ies/backend/src/ies_backend/schemas/flow_session.py`: Added orientation-specific schemas (lines 114-168)
  - **Strand schema:** id, name (e.g., "The Shame Loop"), description, starting_entities list
  - **EntitySummary schema:** id, name, type, summary, connection_count (lightweight for UI display)
  - **OrientationRequest:** Captures spark context with flexible field support (at least one context field required)
  - **OrientationResponse:** Returns extracted entities and suggested strands for UI presentation
  - **Naming convention:** All field aliases use camelCase for JavaScript/TypeScript frontend compatibility
- **SiYuan Plugin Context Menu Integration** — Flow initiation from document titles with orientation support:
  - `.worktrees/siyuan/ies/plugin/src/index.ts`: Context menu handler for "Start Flow from this note" (lines 176-200)
  - **User flow:** Right-click note title → Select "Start Flow from this note" → Opens IES with Flow Mode pre-loaded
  - **Context capture:** Extracts noteId (protyle.block.rootID), noteTitle (protyle.title.editElement.textContent), notebookId
  - **State management:** Updates noteContext store with current note before opening Flow
  - **Integration:** Calls openFlowWithContext() to transition to Flow view with orientation request
  - **Icon:** Uses 'iconFlow' custom SVG icon in context menu
  - **Purpose:** Low-friction Flow initiation directly from SiYuan documents (no manual navigation required)
- **Dashboard Quick Capture Queue** — Enhanced capture status filtering with visual status indicators:
  - `.worktrees/siyuan/ies/plugin/src/views/Dashboard.svelte`: Added capture_status filtering for Quick Capture queue (lines 104-141)
  - **Filter options:** All, Raw (⬜), Classified (🔄), Processed (✅) with emoji indicators
  - **CaptureStatus type:** Imported from types/blocks with CAPTURE_STATUS_LABELS mapping
  - **Computed filter:** Reactive `filteredCaptureQueue` based on captureStatusFilter selection
  - **Queue display:** Shows title, content_preview, captured_at, capture_status, resonance_signal, energy_level
  - **Integration:** Supports Quick Capture → Inbox workflow with AI classification tracking
  - **Purpose:** ADHD-friendly queue management with visual status progression (raw → classified → processed)
- **Context Store (SiYuan Plugin)** — New reactive store for tracking current note context:
  - `.worktrees/siyuan/ies/plugin/src/stores/contextStore.ts`: Writable store for noteContext with helper functions
  - **State fields:** noteId (SiYuan block ID), noteTitle (document title), notebookId (parent notebook)
  - **Exported helpers:** hasNoteOpen (derived store checking if noteId exists), currentNoteTitle (derived store for title access)
  - **Context tracking:** initContextTracking() and destroyContextTracking() lifecycle hooks
  - **Integration:** Used by context menu handlers and Flow Mode for orientation request building
  - **Purpose:** Preserves user's current location when initiating Flow from notes
- **Backend Book Streaming Fix (Dec 6)** — Fixed epub.js inline reading with StreamingResponse:
  - **Commit:** `72f6228: fix(reader): Add missing proxy config and error handling for book loading`
  - **Problem:** FileResponse with Content-Disposition header caused epub.js to download instead of reading inline
  - **Solution:** StreamingResponse with 64KB chunks, no Content-Disposition header
  - **Implementation (books.py, lines 105-132):**
    - Changed return type from `FileResponse` to `StreamingResponse`
    - Generator function `file_iterator()` yields 64KB chunks for memory efficiency
    - Headers: Content-Type (application/epub+zip or application/pdf), Content-Length only
    - Media type determined by file extension (.epub vs .pdf)
  - **Impact:** epub.js can now read book files directly in browser without download prompts
  - **Related:** Works with updated vite proxy config (all endpoints now use 127.0.0.1 instead of localhost)
- **Vite Proxy Configuration Enhancement (Dec 6)** — Fixed IPv6 resolution issues and added health check endpoint:
  - **Commit:** `72f6228: fix(reader): Add missing proxy config and error handling for book loading`
  - **Problem:** `localhost` resolves to IPv6 `::1` on some systems, causing backend connection failures
  - **Solution:** Use `127.0.0.1` explicitly for all backend proxies (vite.config.ts lines 131-165)
  - **Updated proxies:** `/api`, `/books`, `/graph`, `/profile`, `/question-engine`, `/journeys` (all now 127.0.0.1:8081)
  - **New proxy added:** `/health` endpoint for backend availability checks
  - **Pattern:** All proxies use `target: 'http://127.0.0.1:8081'` with `changeOrigin: true`
  - **Impact:** Reliable backend connection across different OS network configurations
  - **Related:** Complements StreamingResponse fix for complete book loading flow
- **Reader Error Handling Enhancement (Dec 6)** — Improved loading timeout with better state management:
  - **Commit:** `72f6228: fix(reader): Add missing proxy config and error handling for book loading`
  - **Enhanced Timeout System (Reader.tsx, lines 24-44):**
    - 15-second loading timeout with console logging for debugging
    - `useEffect` cleanup prevents timeout from triggering after component unmount
    - Conditional execution: only runs if loading and no existing error
    - Console markers: `[Reader] Starting 15s loading timeout...` and `[Reader] Loading timeout reached!`
  - **Error Recovery Flow (Reader.tsx, lines 156-181):**
    - Dedicated error overlay with AlertCircle icon (lucide-react)
    - "Try Again" button resets error state and forces re-render by toggling location to 0
    - "Back to Library" button conditionally shown when onClose callback provided
    - Error actions div groups buttons with proper spacing
  - **Loading State Coordination (Reader.tsx, line 148):**
    - Loading overlay now checks `isLoading && !loadError` to prevent simultaneous display
    - Error state takes precedence over loading state for better UX
  - **ReactReader Conditional Rendering (Reader.tsx, line 184):**
    - Entire reader content wrapped in `{!loadError && ...}` to hide on error
    - Prevents epub.js from attempting to load when in error state
    - `loadingView` prop added to ReactReader for custom loading display (lines 199-203)
  - **State Management Pattern:**
    - Three states: `isLoading` (boolean), `loadError` (string | null), `location` (string | number)
    - Error recovery resets: `setLoadError(null)`, `setIsLoading(true)`, `setLocation(0)`
    - Location reset to 0 forces ReactReader to re-mount and retry
  - **Debug Logging:**
    - Mount logging with URL, title, calibreId (lines 25-28)
    - getRendition success logging: `[Reader] getRendition called - book loaded successfully!` (line 64)
    - Timeout logging for diagnosing slow network/missing files
  - **Impact:**
    - Users see specific error messages instead of infinite loading spinners
    - Retry mechanism with proper state reset enables recovery without full page reload
    - Debug logs help diagnose book loading issues in production

- **Tauri Dynamic Import Pattern (Dec 6)** — Fixed static Tauri imports breaking web mode across auth and settings:
  - `.worktrees/readest/readest/apps/readest-app/src/app/auth/utils/nativeAuth.ts`: Removed static `import { type as osType }`, replaced with dynamic `await import('@tauri-apps/plugin-os')` inside `authWithSafari()` function (lines 13-14)
  - `.worktrees/readest/readest/apps/readest-app/src/app/auth/utils/appleIdAuth.ts`: Same pattern in `getAppleIdAuth()` function (lines 27-28)
  - `.worktrees/readest/readest/apps/readest-app/src/app/reader/components/KOSyncSettings.tsx`: Dynamic import inside `getOsName()` async function with fallback to `getOSPlatform()` for web (lines 91-92)
  - **Problem:** Static Tauri imports execute module-level code requiring Tauri APIs, causing crashes when running in browser context (`pnpm dev` for web debugging)
  - **Solution:** Dynamic imports `await import('@tauri-apps/plugin-os')` only execute when functions are called in actual Tauri environment
  - **Pattern:** Move Tauri imports inside async functions that only run in Tauri context, with graceful fallback for web
  - **Impact:** Readest can now run in both Tauri (desktop/mobile apps) and web modes without crashes
  - **Related:** Follows same pattern as `nativeAppService.ts` (commit 51b8ee3) and `environment.ts` (commit 7c9ca46) for Tauri/web compatibility
- **✅ Readest Remediation Complete (Dec 5-6)** — All critical bugs fixed, core UX features implemented:
  - `.worktrees/readest/TASK.md`: Status updated to REMEDIATION COMPLETE (Dec 5-6)
  - **BUG-R01 Fix:** Event listener memory leak resolved with proper cleanup (FoliateViewer.tsx lines 102-113)
    - Implemented `iframeDocsRef` Map tracking for all iframe documents and their event listeners
    - Added cleanup function in useEffect to remove all 9 event listener types (keydown, keyup, mousedown, mouseup, click, wheel, touchstart, touchmove, touchend)
    - Prevents memory accumulation during book navigation and page rendering
  - **All Priority 1 bugs resolved:** BUG-R01 (memory leak), BUG-R02 (regex performance), BUG-R03/R04 (AbortController), BUG-R05 (singleton stale config)
  - **All Priority 2 UX features complete:** Entity highlights clickable, question response input, journey breadcrumbs visible, state persistence
  - **Priority 3 design system integration:** IES design system imported, entity colors aligned, typography applied
  - **Success criteria met:** Thinking partnership (questions interactive), ADHD-friendly (entity overlay), virtuous cycle (journey tracking), design cohesion (IES system)
  - **Impact:** Readest Layer 4 now production-ready for user testing

  - **Backend health check fix:** Aligned `BackendHealth` interface with Dashboard expectations (`ok`, `backendUrl`, `checkedAt`, `message` fields)
  - **Notebook preferences:** Added 'IES' to default notebook names for better domain-agnostic alignment
  - **Error handling enhancement:** `callBackendApi()` now properly throws errors instead of returning null, with detailed logging
  - **Purpose:** Completes merged architecture with full Package 07_System layer, fixes health check interface mismatch
- **ForgeMode Interactive Question-Response System (Phase 4 Remediation)** — Implements active cognitive guidance instead of passive question display:
  - `.worktrees/siyuan/ies/plugin/src/views/ForgeMode.svelte`: Complete interactive question-response workflow (1400+ lines)
  - **Question-response card:** `.question-response-card` component with class-specific colored borders, expandable hint section, textarea for user response
  - **Cognitive hints:** `QUESTION_CLASS_HINTS` provides class-specific guidance prompts (e.g., Schema-Probe: "Try listing the main categories, components, or buckets")
  - **Response starters:** Optional sentence starters to reduce friction (e.g., "The main parts are...", "This happens because...")
  - **Interactive flow:** User sees question → expands for hints → types response → submits → AI processes response → generates follow-up
  - **Session tracking:** Question-response exchanges captured in `questionResponseHistory` for transcript inclusion
  - **Impact:** Addresses critical finding "Questions displayed passively" — questions now drive active dialogue with cognitive scaffolding
  - **UI styling:** Complete CSS system (~440 lines) with `.qrc-header`, `.qrc-question`, `.qrc-hint`, `.qrc-input`, `.qrc-starter`/`.qrc-skip`/`.qrc-respond` buttons

  - **Quick Capture System (Defining Feature):**
    - Status lifecycle: raw (just landed) → classified (AI metadata added) → processed (user decided placement)
    - AI boundaries: Automatic (add auto_summary, auto_labels, linked_concepts) vs. Interactive (move blocks, split seedlings, attach to projects, mark processed)
    - Capture channels: phone, Readest, web, voice, other
    - Schema fields: quick_capture, capture_channel, capture_source, capture_time, capture_status, auto_summary, auto_labels, linked_concepts, optional book metadata
  - **Migration Strategy:** Hybrid approach preserving ADHD-friendly features (energy levels, resonance signals, backend API integration, Question Engine) while adding Quick Capture lifecycle, Seedling types, formal block schemas, Project structure, Flow Maps, Archive system
  - **Implementation Priority:** Foundation (update STRUCTURE_FOLDERS, add Quick Capture schema, status lifecycle) → UI Components (Quick Capture Queue sidebar, "Process this capture" workflow, Seedling type selection) → Templates (port Markdown templates, Concept Page structure, Flow Map templates) → Integration (backend APIs, AI classification, health checks)
- **Interactive Thinking Partner Questions (Readest)** — Expandable question-response system with journey tracking:
  - `.worktrees/readest/readest/apps/readest-app/src/app/reader/components/flowpanel/QuestionsSection.tsx` — Interactive Q&A with journey tracking (210 lines)
  - **Expandable questions:** Click to reveal textarea for response input (useState expandedIndex tracking)

  - **Related entities:** Shows related entity chips when question has relatedEntities array
  - **Integration:** Questions section in FlowPanel.tsx shows thinking partner questions from backend
- **Journey Breadcrumb Visualization (Readest)** — Makes invisible knowledge journeys visible and navigable:
  - `.worktrees/readest/readest/apps/readest-app/src/app/reader/components/flowpanel/JourneyBreadcrumb.tsx` — Shows last 5 journey steps with entity names, dwell time, overflow count (98 lines)
  - **Step navigation:** Click any breadcrumb step to revisit that entity in Flow panel (handleStepClick function)
  - **Dwell time display:** Inline time indicators (seconds/minutes) show engagement per entity with LuClock icon
  - **Journey marks counter:** Displays count of saved notes/annotations/questions from exploration
  - **Overflow handling:** Shows "+N more" when journey path exceeds 5 steps
  - **Integration:** Integrated into FlowPanel.tsx with LuRoute icon header section
  - **Purpose:** Addresses UX gap where journeys were tracked but never shown to user
- **Flow Panel Component Reorganization (Readest)** — Clean module structure for Flow panel subsystems:
  - `.worktrees/readest/readest/apps/readest-app/src/app/reader/components/flowpanel/index.ts` — Centralized exports for 7 components
  - **Exported components:** FlowPanel, FlowPanelHeader, EntitySection, RelationshipsSection, SourcesSection, QuestionsSection, JourneyBreadcrumb
  - **Benefits:** Enables clean imports `import { FlowPanel, JourneyBreadcrumb } from './flowpanel'`, modular architecture where each section is independently fetchable and testable
  - **Integration:** ReaderContent.tsx imports FlowPanel from index, all Flow panel features accessed through single import point
- **Dashboard Energy-Based Navigation (SiYuan)** — ADHD-friendly spark filtering with dynamic backend configuration:
  - `.worktrees/siyuan/ies/plugin/src/views/Dashboard.svelte` — Energy filters (low/medium/high) and resonance filters (8 emotional signals) for mood-appropriate navigation
  - **Energy filters:** All, Low (🔋), Medium (⚡), High (🔥) with mutually exclusive selection
  - **Resonance filters:** 8 emotional signals (curious, excited, surprised, moved, disturbed, unclear, connected, validated) with emoji labels
  - **Backend health checking:** Connected/Checking/Disconnected status with manual retry, 30-second cache TTL
  - **Flow mode concept navigation:** Clicking suggestions in "Most Connected" or "Novel Concepts" passes concept name to FlowMode for pre-selected exploration
  - **API endpoints:** `/personal/sparks/by-energy/{level}`, `/personal/sparks/by-resonance/{signal}` for filtered spark retrieval
  - **Empty state handling:** Shows friendly message when filters return no results with "Show all sparks" option
- **Complete Entity Click-to-Flow Interaction System (Readest)** — Full event loop from text overlay to exploration:
  - `.worktrees/readest/readest/apps/readest-app/src/app/reader/hooks/useEntityClick.ts` — Event listener hook handles entity-click events from iframe content (88 lines)
  - **Event flow:** Entity highlighted → User clicks → Event dispatched → Flow panel opens → Entity fetched → Journey step added
  - **Temporary display:** Shows "Loading..." while fetching full details from knowledge graph
  - **Graceful fallback:** If entity not in graph, displays helpful message explaining extraction status
  - **Integration points:**
    - useEntityClick() called in ReaderContent.tsx (line 52) to wire up event handling
    - iframeEventHandlers.ts dispatches 'entity-click' events from iframe content
    - useFlowEntity.ts hook provides entity search/fetch capabilities
    - graphClient.ts handles backend API calls for entity data
    - flowModeStore.ts manages state: currentEntity, journey steps, loading states
  - **Critical bug fix (BUG-R03):** AbortController pattern prevents memory leaks from cancelled entity fetches
  - Works with entity transformer overlay system for seamless click-to-explore experience
- **Entity Transformer Performance Fix (Readest)** — Eliminated catastrophic backtracking with trie-based matching:
  - `.worktrees/readest/readest/apps/readest-app/src/services/transformers/entity.ts` — Trie-based entity matching prevents O(n*m) catastrophic backtracking (BUG-R02)
  - **buildEntityTrie():** Constructs case-insensitive trie from entity names supporting multi-word phrases
  - **processTextWithTrie():** Linear O(n) text scan with efficient phrase matching
  - **Multi-word support:** Handles "executive function", "cognitive behavioral therapy" etc.
  - **Longest match preference:** Trie prioritizes longer entity names when overlapping
  - **Impact:** Eliminates browser freezes when highlighting books with 100+ entities (previously caused 5-10 second hangs)
  - **Algorithm change:** From regex alternations `(entity1|entity2|...)` (exponential) to token-based trie lookup (linear)
- **Journey Breadcrumb Visualization (Readest)** — Makes invisible knowledge journeys visible and navigable:
  - `.worktrees/readest/readest/apps/readest-app/src/app/reader/components/flowpanel/JourneyBreadcrumb.tsx` — Shows last 5 journey steps with entity names, dwell time, overflow count (98 lines)
  - **Step navigation:** Click any breadcrumb step to revisit that entity in Flow panel (handleStepClick function)
  - **Dwell time display:** Inline time indicators (seconds/minutes) show engagement per entity with LuClock icon
  - **Journey marks counter:** Displays count of saved notes/annotations/questions from exploration
  - **Overflow handling:** Shows "+N more" when journey path exceeds 5 steps
  - **Integration:** Integrated into FlowPanel.tsx with LuRoute icon header section
  - **Purpose:** Addresses UX gap where journeys were tracked but never shown to user
- **Interactive Thinking Partner Questions (Readest)** — Expandable question-response system with journey tracking:
  - `.worktrees/readest/readest/apps/readest-app/src/app/reader/components/flowpanel/QuestionsSection.tsx` — Interactive Q&A with journey tracking (210 lines)
  - **Expandable questions:** Click to reveal textarea for response input (useState expandedIndex tracking)
  - **Response submission:** Cmd/Ctrl+Enter shortcut (handleKeyDown), tracks exchanges in journey breadcrumb
  - **Question types:** Visual labels for clarifying/connecting/challenging questions with type-specific styling
  - **Bookmark feature:** Save questions as journey marks for later reflection (addJourneyMark)
  - **Submitted responses tracked:** UI shows submitted answers in green success card, clears input after submission
  - **Auto-focus:** Textarea automatically focused when question expanded (useRef with setTimeout)
  - **Related entities:** Shows related entity chips when question has relatedEntities array
  - **Integration:** Questions section in FlowPanel.tsx shows thinking partner questions from backend
- **Flow Panel Component Reorganization (Readest)** — Clean module structure for Flow panel subsystems:
  - `.worktrees/readest/readest/apps/readest-app/src/app/reader/components/flowpanel/index.ts` — Centralized exports for 7 components
  - **Exported components:** FlowPanel, FlowPanelHeader, EntitySection, RelationshipsSection, SourcesSection, QuestionsSection, JourneyBreadcrumb
  - **Benefits:** Enables clean imports `import { FlowPanel, JourneyBreadcrumb } from './flowpanel'`, modular architecture where each section is independently fetchable and testable
  - **Integration:** ReaderContent.tsx imports FlowPanel from index, all Flow panel features accessed through single import point
- **Dashboard Energy-Based Navigation (SiYuan)** — ADHD-friendly spark filtering with dynamic backend configuration:
  - `.worktrees/siyuan/ies/plugin/src/views/Dashboard.svelte` — Energy filters (low/medium/high) and resonance filters (8 emotional signals) for mood-appropriate navigation
  - **Energy filters:** All, Low (🔋), Medium (⚡), High (🔥) with mutually exclusive selection
  - **Resonance filters:** 8 emotional signals (curious, excited, surprised, moved, disturbed, unclear, connected, validated) with emoji labels
  - **Backend health checking:** Connected/Checking/Disconnected status with manual retry, 30-second cache TTL
  - **Flow mode concept navigation:** Clicking suggestions in "Most Connected" or "Novel Concepts" passes concept name to FlowMode for pre-selected exploration
  - **API endpoints:** `/personal/sparks/by-energy/{level}`, `/personal/sparks/by-resonance/{signal}` for filtered spark retrieval
  - **Empty state handling:** Shows friendly message when filters return no results with "Show all sparks" option
- **Domain-Agnostic Notebook Configuration (SiYuan)** (commit 5e3ad8b) — Removed hardcoded therapy-specific notebook names:
  - `.worktrees/siyuan/ies/plugin/src/utils/siyuan-structure.ts`: Replaced `PREFERRED_NOTEBOOK_NAMES` with `DEFAULT_NOTEBOOK_NAMES` and `getPreferredNotebookNames()`
  - **User-configurable preferences:** Users can customize via localStorage `ies.preferredNotebooks` as JSON array
  - **Default names now domain-agnostic:** "Personal", "Knowledge", "Notes", "Intelligent Exploration System" (removed "Therapy", "Therapy Framework", "Framework Project")
  - **Backward compatible:** Falls back to defaults if localStorage is unavailable or parse fails
  - **Improved health checking:** Added `BackendHealth` interface, `cachedHealthStatus` variable, and `HEALTH_CACHE_TTL_MS` constant (30 seconds)
  - **Backend URL context comments:** Added clarification that SiYuan runs in Docker on 192.168.86.60, forwardProxy makes requests FROM container using host IP
  - **Question class tracking in sessions:** Added `questionClassesUsed?: string[]` field to `SessionDocumentOptions` interface
  - **Session document frontmatter:** Sessions now include `question_classes_used` array in YAML frontmatter when question classes are tracked
  - **Impact:** Plugin now works across any domain without therapy-specific assumptions, aligns with project goal of domain-agnostic architecture
- **IES AST Mode Documentation** (commit 3b347fc) — Comprehensive SiYuan notebook structure defining assisted structured thinking architecture:
  - `IES AST SiYuan structure.md`: Tracking document for 20 new SiYuan pages across 6 sections (Modes, Question Engine, Data Schemas, Specs, Templates, Workflows)
  - **Four thinking modes:** Discovery (schema surfacing), Dialogue (model building), Flow (associative exploration), AST (assisted structured thinking)
  - **Nine question classes:** Schema-Probe (hidden structure), Boundary (clarify edges), Dimensional (introduce spectra), Causal (mechanisms), Counterfactual (what-if), Anchor (concrete instances), Perspective-Shift (viewpoint change), Meta-Cognitive (thinking patterns), Reflective-Synthesis (integration)
  - **Mode Transition Engine:** Automatic mode switching based on interaction cadence, cognitive load markers, and resonance hits
  - **User Cognition Model integration:** 6-dimension profile drives template defaults and question class selection
  - **ADHD-friendly folder structure:** `/Daily/` (zero-friction capture), `/Insights/` (promoted sparks), `/Threads/` (exploration paths), `/Favorite Problems/` (anchor questions), `/Concepts/` (knowledge graph nodes)
  - **Data Schemas:** Seed Schema (atomic insights), Concept Schema (persistent ideas with causal structure), Block Attributes (SiYuan metadata standards), Note Templates (per-mode session templates)
  - **Integration:** AST mode bridges ForgeMode templates with Flow exploration, provides canonical placement for sparks/insights
  - **Documentation updates:** SYSTEM-DESIGN.md adds Section 3.7 (SiYuan AST Structure), PROJECT-OVERVIEW.md adds IES Question Engine preview, COMPREHENSIVE-PROJECT-STATUS.md updated with documentation status
  - **Source:** Based on IES Question Engine expansion spec synthesized with existing ADHD ontology design research

**Recent Changes (Dec 4):**
- **Entity Overlay UI Redesign** (commits 0b646cf, fddd8f0, 8887e90) — Enhanced user experience with pill-based controls and Flow Panel integration:
  - `.worktrees/readest/readest/apps/readest-app/src/app/reader/components/EntityTypeFilter.tsx`: Complete redesign from checkbox-based to pill-based UI (122 lines)
  - **Master toggle redesign:** Replaced checkbox with prominent ON/OFF button featuring eye icons (LuEye/LuEyeOff from react-icons)
  - **Pill controls:** Interactive type-specific pills replace traditional checkboxes for more intuitive visual feedback
  - **Active state styling:** Pills show type-specific colors with 12% opacity backgrounds when active, muted appearance when inactive
  - **Status indicator:** Centered display shows entity count ("X entities in this book"), loading spinner, error messages, or "Book not indexed" warning
  - **Disabled interaction:** Pills are properly disabled when overlay is off to prevent user confusion
  - **Flow Panel integration:** EntityTypeFilter positioned at top of Flow Panel (FlowPanel.tsx lines 156-159) for immediate access
  - **Flow Panel components updated:** EntitySection, RelationshipsSection, SourcesSection, QuestionsSection, Header all refined with type-specific badges and consistent styling
  - **CSS styling system:** Complete entity overlay styling in `globals.css` (lines 559-618 for filter controls, 756-855 for inline highlights)
  - **Type-specific colors:** Blue (Concept #2563eb), Green (Person #059669), Purple (Theory #7c3aed), Orange (Framework #ea580c), Red (Assessment #dc2626)
  - **Hover effects:** Underline decoration appears on hover with type-specific color transitions for both pills and inline highlights
  - **Visual consistency:** All Flow Panel sections now use consistent design language with flow-card, flow-section-header, relationship-badge classes
- **Template API for ForgeMode Integration** (commit 9fcc171) — New backend endpoint enables structured thinking sessions:
  - `ies/backend/src/ies_backend/api/template.py`: New FastAPI router with `GET /templates/{template_id}` endpoint (24 lines)
  - Returns `ThinkingTemplate` schema with sections, graph mapping rules, and AI behavior specifications
  - Registered in `ies/backend/src/ies_backend/main.py` with `/templates` prefix
  - Integration: `.worktrees/siyuan/ies/plugin/src/views/ForgeMode.svelte` fetches templates via SiYuan forwardProxy
  - Available templates: `learning-mechanism-map` (understand mechanisms), `articulating-clarify-intuition` (clarify vague thoughts)
  - Enables template-driven sessions with section-by-section progress tracking in ForgeMode UI
- **Auto Ingestion Daemon Operational** — Fixed critical Book-Entity relationship structure for full entity overlay compatibility:
  - `scripts/auto_ingest_daemon.py`: Fixed MENTIONS relationship creation between Book and Entity nodes (lines 150-156)
  - **Problem:** Auto-ingested books had entities but missing direct Book→MENTIONS→Entity relationships required by entity overlay feature
  - **Solution:** After entity extraction, daemon now creates MENTIONS relationships for each entity: `MATCH (b:Book {calibre_id: $calibre_id}) MATCH (e) WHERE e.name = $entity_name MERGE (b)-[:MENTIONS]->(e)`
  - **Impact:** Books processed by daemon now fully support entity overlay in Readest reading interface
  - **Results:** Successfully processed 9 out of 10 Calibre books with entity counts ranging from 6 to 169 entities per book
  - **Graph structure:** Now matches expected schema for `GET /graph/entities/by-calibre-id/{calibre_id}` endpoint
  - **Daemon status:** Background processing operational, running every 5 minutes with comprehensive entity extraction and proper Book-Entity linking
  - **Entity overlay requirement:** Books must be opened via Calibre Library dialog in Readest (not local library) to access indexed content
  - **SiYuan integration:** Suggestions API working and returns both connected entity suggestions and new entity recommendations
- **Tauri Runtime Detection Enhancement** — Fixed browser crashes with deep object validation (commit 7c9ca46):
  - `.worktrees/readest/readest/apps/readest-app/src/services/environment.ts`: Enhanced `isTauriAppPlatform()` with five-point validation
  - Problem: Setting `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_PLATFORM=tauri` alone caused app to attempt Tauri API calls in browser context, leading to crashes
  - Root cause: Partial `__TAURI_INTERNALS__` objects can exist in browser context without full Tauri functionality
  - Solution: Five-point validation ensures BOTH environment configuration AND complete Tauri runtime availability
  - Implementation checks:
    1. `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_PLATFORM === 'tauri'` — Environment configured for Tauri
    2. `typeof window !== 'undefined'` — Browser context exists (prevents SSR errors)
    3. `window.__TAURI_INTERNALS__ !== undefined` — Tauri object exists
    4. `typeof internals === 'object' && internals !== null` — Valid object structure
    5. `typeof internals.invoke === 'function'` — Critical: Full Tauri API available with invoke function
  - Rationale: Previous simple check (`'__TAURI_INTERNALS__' in window`) was insufficient because partial objects can exist without invoke capability
  - Safety: Each validation step builds on previous, preventing TypeError exceptions in edge cases
  - Impact: App gracefully falls back to WebAppService when running in browser, even if environment variable is incorrectly set
  - Use case: Enables running `pnpm dev` in browser for debugging without breaking Tauri-specific code paths
  - Pattern: `getNativeAppService()` catches Tauri plugin load failures and falls back to WebAppService
  - Related: `.worktrees/readest/readest/apps/readest-app/src/services/nativeAppService.ts` uses dynamic import for `@tauri-apps/plugin-os`
- **Readest Native Service Dynamic Import Fix** (commit 51b8ee3) — Fixed browser/Tauri context compatibility with dynamic plugin loading:
  - `.worktrees/readest/readest/apps/readest-app/src/services/nativeAppService.ts`: Removed static import of `@tauri-apps/plugin-os`, replaced with dynamic import
  - Problem: Static `import { type as osType } from '@tauri-apps/plugin-os'` executes module-level code requiring Tauri APIs, causing Next.js build failures in browser context
  - Solution: Dynamic import pattern with async initialization
  - Implementation: `initOsType()` async function calls `await import('@tauri-apps/plugin-os')` and caches result in `_osType` variable
  - Execution: `initOsType()` invoked at start of `NativeAppService.init()` method, which only runs in actual Tauri environment
  - Impact: All 20+ OS-type-dependent properties converted from static values to getters calling `getOsType()` (e.g., `override get isAndroidApp() { return getOsType() === 'android'; }`)
  - Pattern: Dynamic import ensures Tauri plugin only loads when running in Tauri, not during Next.js bundling for browser
  - Result: Eliminates module-level code execution that fails in browser/SSR contexts
- **Relationship Type Sanitization** — Enhanced Neo4j relationship creation with robust type validation:
  - `library/graph/neo4j_client.py`: `add_relationship()` method now sanitizes relationship types before creating Neo4j relationships
  - Replaces spaces and hyphens with underscores (e.g., "RELATED TO" → "RELATED_TO")
  - Removes invalid characters using regex (only A-Z, 0-9, underscore allowed in Neo4j relationship types)
  - Fallback to "RELATED_TO" for empty/invalid types
  - Prevents Neo4j Cypher syntax errors during ingestion from malformed relationship type names
- **GraphService Entity Query Fix** (Dec 4) — Critical alignment between ingestion and query patterns:
  - **Problem:** Entity overlay failing because queries used old Book<-Chunk->Entity pattern while ingestion creates direct Book->Entity relationships
  - **Solution:** Modified `get_entities_by_calibre_id()` and `get_entities_by_book()` to use `MATCH (b)-[:MENTIONS]->(e)` pattern
  - **Root cause:** `scripts/ingest_calibre.py` creates direct Book-MENTIONS->Entity relationships without intermediate Chunk nodes
  - **Impact:** Entity overlay now works correctly by matching actual graph structure created during book ingestion
  - **Pattern change:** From `MATCH (b)<-[:BELONGS_TO]-(chunk)-[:MENTIONS]->(e)` to `MATCH (b)-[:MENTIONS]->(e)`
  - **Files changed:** `ies/backend/src/ies_backend/services/graph_service.py` lines 218 and 267
- **Calibre Integration Phase 3 Complete (Commit 3c2efde)** — Multi-pass ingestion pipeline for Calibre books into Neo4j:
  - Ingestion script: `scripts/ingest_calibre.py` — Extracts entities from Calibre books and stores in Neo4j with `calibre_id` as primary identifier (263 lines)
  - Multi-pass pipeline: Pass 1 (structure: Book node + chunks + entities + MENTIONS relationships → status: entities_extracted)
  - Future passes: Pass 2 (relationships), Pass 3 (LLM enrichment with reframes, mechanisms, patterns)
  - Migration script: `scripts/match_calibre_ids.py` — Matches existing Neo4j Book nodes to Calibre books by title/author similarity for one-time migration (167 lines)
  - KnowledgeGraph updates: `add_book()` accepts `calibre_id` parameter, `book_exists()` checks by calibre_id, `update_book_status()` tracks processing lifecycle
  - Entity extraction: Uses existing `EntityExtractor` from `library/graph/entities.py` with OpenAI
  - Status lifecycle: `pending → chunked → entities_extracted → relationships_mapped → enriched`
  - CLI features: `--id` (single book), `--test` (one book test), `--status` (processing stats), `--limit` (batch size)
  - Library path: `/home/chris/Documents/calibre` (179 books)
- **Calibre Integration Phase 2 Complete (Commit 9542ec2, updated 6d607af)** — Backend APIs for Calibre book library access:
  - New `CalibreService` queries Calibre `metadata.db` SQLite database with `get_book_file_path()` method (128 lines)
  - New `Book` schema with `calibre_id`, `title`, `author`, `path` (Pydantic model)
  - Books API: `GET /books`, `GET /books?search=`, `GET /books/{calibre_id}`, `GET /books/{calibre_id}/cover` (125 lines)
  - **File serving endpoints:** `HEAD /books/{calibre_id}/file` (metadata only), `GET /books/{calibre_id}/file` (epub/pdf download)
  - File serving: Prefers epub over pdf, serves with correct media types (application/epub+zip or application/pdf)
  - GraphService: New `get_entities_by_calibre_id()` method for direct Calibre ID entity lookup (47 lines)
  - Entity API: New `GET /graph/entities/by-calibre-id/{calibre_id}` endpoint (20 lines)
  - Tests: 85/85 backend tests passing (6 CalibreService tests, 6 Books API tests, 3 entity endpoint tests)
  - Eliminates hash/title matching fragility by using Calibre as single source of truth
- **Backend Refactoring** (commit a9ce87b) — Enhanced session processing and state detection:
  - New `SessionService` extracted from `session.py` for cleaner separation of concerns (142 lines)
  - Orchestrates session extraction, storage, and template mapping pipeline
  - Enhanced `StateDetectionService` with improved word boundary matching for marker detection
  - Added context handling for repetition detection and emotional state analysis
  - Book entities API: Added `title` query parameter for dual identifier strategy (hash OR title matching)
  - ADHD ontology exports: Added `Reframe` and `ReframeType` to `library/graph/__init__.py`
  - Schema updates: Additional entity fields for session processing
  - Tests: 70/70 backend tests passing (all question_engine tests fixed)
- **Entity Overlay Feature Complete** (commit 3a513b2) — Real-time entity highlighting in Readest reading interface:
  - Backend: GET `/graph/entities/by-book/{book_hash}` endpoint returns entities sorted by mention frequency
  - GraphService: `get_entities_by_book()` method with entity type filtering support
  - Frontend: Entity overlay transformer wraps entity mentions in styled spans for inline highlighting
  - UI: EntityTypeFilter component with master toggle and per-type visibility controls (Concept, Person, Theory, Framework, Assessment)
  - State: flowModeStore manages overlay state, entity fetching, and type filtering
  - Integration: FoliateViewer auto-fetches entities on book load, transforms HTML content with entity highlights
  - Tests: 70/70 backend tests passing (3 new tests for book_entities endpoint)
- **Phase 2c Backend Complete** (commit 46bc30b) — Three integrated backend services addressing critical gaps #1 and #2:
  - Reframe API (`/reframes`) — Concept reframes via Claude Sonnet 4 with caching and feedback voting
  - Personal Graph API (`/personal`) — ADHD-friendly spark/insight capture with resonance and energy-based retrieval
  - Template Service — JSON-based thinking templates with validation and graph mapping execution
- Updated `library/graph/__init__.py` to export unified graph API with ADHD-friendly ontology implementation for personal knowledge capture.
