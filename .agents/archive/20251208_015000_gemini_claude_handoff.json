I also verified the status of the ongoing IES Reader Wave 3 tasks:
- Section 1 (Mobile Nav & FAB): Implemented ✅
- Section 3.3 (Selection Action Bar): Implemented ✅
- Section 4.1 (Touch Targets): Partially done. Global buttons in design-system.css are 40px; the plan requires 44px for mobile compliance.

I am ready to proceed with fixing the touch targets or awaiting new instructions.",
