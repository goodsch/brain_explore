F. Skinner (duplicate with 'Skinner')\n- Brailsford (duplicate with 'Dave Brailsford')\n- Charles Duhigg\n- Scott Adams\n\n**Theories (2):**\n- Four Laws of Behavior Change\n- four-step model of habits (cue, craving, response, reward)\n\n## Review Criteria\n\n1. **Completeness (0-10):** What key concepts from the book are missing?\n   - e.g., identity-based habits, habit stacking, temptation bundling, environment design, etc.\n\n2. **Accuracy (0-10):** Are the descriptions correct and meaningful?\n\n3. **Deduplication (0-10):** Note duplicates (Skinner/B.F. Skinner, Brailsford/Dave Brailsford)\n\n4. **Relationship Quality (0-10):** Should there be more connections between entities?\n\n5. **Overall Grade (A-F):** Summary assessment\n\n## Deliverable\n\nProvide:\n1. Overall letter grade with justification\n2. List of 5-10 key missing concepts that should be extracted\n3. Specific recommendations for improving the extraction pipeline",
