  "message": "Implement the mobile notes capture system from Wave 3 design. This includes: (1) NotesSheet.tsx - a bottom sheet component for notes on mobile, (2) A floating action button (FAB) that appears on mobile to trigger the notes sheet, (3) Integration with the existing NotesCapture component. The design spec is at docs/plans/2025-12-07-ies-reader-wave3-design.md Section 3. Use the existing Sheet.tsx component as a base. The FAB should only appear on mobile (max-width: 767px) and should be positioned bottom-right with safe-area handling.",
