# Therapy Framework Progress

*Exploring and articulating therapeutic worldview*

**Start with:** `/explore-session`

## Current State

**Status:** READY FOR EXPLORATION

**SiYuan Location:** Therapy Framework notebook
- Track 1 (Human Mind): 1 concept
- Track 2 (Change Process): 0 concepts
- Track 3 (Method): 0 concepts

## Where We Left Off

**Hanging question from last exploration:**
> "How do you distinguish pain from inaccurate beliefs (addressable) vs. pain that's just part of being a meaning-making creature (unavoidable)?"

This bridges Track 1 (Human Mind) → Track 2 (Change Process)

## Concepts in Progress

| Concept | Status | Track | Location |
|---------|--------|-------|----------|
| Narrow Window of Awareness | developing | 1-Human Mind | SiYuan |
| Meaning-Making as Solution | seed | 1-Human Mind | identified only |
| Unique Personhood | seed | 1-Human Mind | identified only |
| Unnecessary Pain | seed | 2-Change Process | identified only |

## Research Queue

Priority topics to ground concepts:
- Predictive processing (Friston, Clark, Seth)
- Existentialist psychology (Yalom, Frankl)
- Terror Management Theory
- Buddhist psychology (first arrow vs. second arrow)

## Next Exploration Options

1. **Continue hanging question** — necessary vs. unnecessary pain (recommended)
2. **Capture seed concepts** — flesh out Meaning-Making, Unique Personhood, Unnecessary Pain
3. **Research grounding** — find sources for Narrow Window concept
4. **New exploration** — different starting question

### Focus
First exploration: "What is the single most important thing you believe about why humans struggle?"

### Mode Used
Socratic Exploration

### Key Insights

1. **The Narrow Window of Awareness** — We're aware enough to create meaning from limited data, but not aware enough to see our blind spots.

2. **Meaning-making is a solution, not a problem** — 5 senses + pattern-matching brain = "knowing." It's adaptive, not pathological.

3. **The paradox** — Our limitation (narrow awareness) is BOTH the source of suffering AND our unique capacity to experience meaning, beauty, love.

4. **Therapy isn't about "more correct"** — It's about recognizing where beliefs cause UNNECESSARY pain, allowing unique contribution, validating all paths.

5. **People matter simply because** — The brain creates a singular person who matters by existing. No justification needed.
