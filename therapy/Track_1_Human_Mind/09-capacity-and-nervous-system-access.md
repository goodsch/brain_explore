# Capacity as Nervous System Access: Clearing the Way

## Definition

Capacity is not about innate intelligence, talent, or skill. Capacity is about nervous system state making certain capabilities accessible or inaccessible.

**Core Insight:** People have the capacities they need. Therapy doesn't build capacity; it restores access to capacity that was already there but locked away by nervous system state.

## The Three States and Their Access Patterns

- **Hypervigilance:** Consumes cognitive resources in threat assessment; creative and integrative thinking unavailable
- **Shutdown:** All capacities become inaccessible; person is functionally unavailable
- **Regulated Aliveness:** Full access to creativity, curiosity, wisdom, integration, complexity-holding

## The Reframe

**Instead of:** "Can this person become creative/wise/capable?"
**Ask:** "What conditions would allow this person's capacities to show up?"

This shifts therapy from trying to build something new to clearing the path for what's already there.

## Clinical Application

When a client says "I can't," the question becomes:
- Is this a genuine limitation (narrow window)?
- Or is the capacity present but inaccessible due to nervous system state?

If it's the latter, therapy becomes about restoring nervous system conditions rather than developing new skills.
