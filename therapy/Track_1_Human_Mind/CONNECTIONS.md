# Concept Connections Map

Track 1: How Humans Think (The Human Mind)

This document maps relationships between therapeutic concepts extracted from exploration sessions.

## Concept Overview

| # | Concept | Status | Session | Key Insight |
|---|---------|--------|---------|------------|
| 01 | Narrow Window of Awareness | Foundational | Session 01 | The narrow window is both limitation and gift |
| 02 | Acceptance vs. Resignation | Developing | Session 02 | Distinction lies in aliveness/energy, not external form |

## Connection Map

### Narrow Window of Awareness (01) ↔ Acceptance vs. Resignation (02)

**Relationship Type:** Foundational → Application

**How they connect:**

1. **Window of awareness determines what's possible to accept**
   - We operate within a narrow window; this is not a flaw
   - Acceptance in therapy works *within* this window, not by expanding it
   - Resignation is a response to accepting the window's limitations

2. **Both acceptance and resignation are forms of meaning-making**
   - Both are valid responses within the narrow window
   - The distinction is in how the person relates to their limitation
   - Aliveness vs. numbness reflects different nervous system configurations

3. **Necessary vs. Unnecessary Pain (01) → Acceptance as Response (02)**
   - Concept 01 distinguishes pain from false beliefs vs. pain from being limited
   - Concept 02 shows that acceptance (with aliveness) is the therapeutic movement toward necessary pain
   - Resignation is turning away; acceptance is turning toward with available energy

**Clinical Application:**
Help clients understand that:
- The narrow window is universal (not pathological)
- Acceptance means attending to what-is-within-the-window with available energy
- Resignation means turning away and shutting down
- The therapeutic stance supports acceptance, not resignation

## Threads Connecting Concepts

### Thread 1: The Role of Attention

- **Concept 01** (Narrow Window): Attention is constrained by the window; we perceive through limited data
- **Concept 02** (Acceptance): Direction of attention (toward vs. away from reality) distinguishes acceptance from resignation
- **Thread Connection**: The narrow window explains *why* we must choose how to attend; accepting the window means consciously directing attention toward what-is

### Thread 2: Nervous System and Aliveness

- **Concept 01** (Narrow Window): The narrow window includes the gift of passion, beauty, meaning—all tied to nervous system engagement
- **Concept 02** (Acceptance): Aliveness and available energy are markers of genuine acceptance vs. shutdown resignation
- **Thread Connection**: Aliveness is not just emotional; it's a nervous system signature that indicates genuine acceptance rather than avoidance/resignation

### Thread 3: Meaning-Making vs. Numbness

- **Concept 01** (Narrow Window): We create meaning; this false-meaning-making is actually the system working as designed
- **Concept 02** (Acceptance): Genuine acceptance preserves the capacity for meaning-making and connection; resignation numbs meaning away
- **Thread Connection**: Acceptance enables continued meaning-making; resignation is disconnection from meaning

## Open Connections (Future Exploration)

### Toward Concept 03: What Enables Movement From Resignation to Acceptance?

**Hypothetical Connection:**
- The gap between Sessions 02 (identifying the distinction) and Sessions 03+ (observing it in practice)
- Questions: What conditions allow someone to move from resignation toward acceptance?
- Research direction: Look for patterns in sessions where this movement occurs

**Topics to explore:**
- The role of therapeutic presence and attunement
- The nervous system's capacity for re-engagement
- Specific practices or relational moves that facilitate acceptance
- How to distinguish protective shutdown (trauma) from resignation (avoidance)

### Toward Concept 04: Individual Differences in Acceptance

**Hypothetical Connection:**
- Concept 02 assumes acceptance/resignation distinction is universal
- But do different people/nervous systems/trauma histories experience these states differently?
- Topics: Neurodiversity, trauma history, temperament, cultural context

## How to Read This Map

1. **Use the Connection Map** to understand how concepts build on each other
2. **Follow Threads** to see larger patterns emerging across concepts
3. **Track Open Connections** to identify what needs exploration in future sessions
4. **Update after each session** — New concepts may create new connections

## Maintenance Notes

- Updated after Session 02 (Dec 2, 2025)
- Concept 02 document complete; waiting for Sessions 03+ before adding Concept 03
- Open questions from Session 02 may generate new concepts in Sessions 03-10
