# Therapy Framework

**Scope:** The actual content — articulating therapeutic worldview

This is the content layer. Work here is about exploring and developing ideas, not building tools.

## What This Is

```
IES (the tool)
    │
    └──► Framework Project (the configuration)
              │
              └──► Therapy Framework (THIS — the content)
```

## The Goal

Articulate a coherent therapeutic worldview across three tracks:

| Track | Focus |
|-------|-------|
| 1-Human Mind | Why humans are the way they are |
| 2-Change Process | How therapy creates change |
| 3-Method | Operational approach |

## Quick Start

Use `/explore-session` to explore ideas. The system handles entity extraction and documentation.

## SiYuan Notebook

Therapy Framework notebook:
- `/1-Human Mind/` — Track 1 concepts
- `/2-Change Process/` — Track 2 concepts
- `/3-Method/` — Track 3 concepts
- `/_Connections/` — Tensions, foundations, open questions
- `/_Inbox/` — Unsorted captures

## Current Concepts

| Concept | Status | Track |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Narrow Window of Awareness | developing | 1-Human Mind |
| Meaning-Making as Solution | seed | 1-Human Mind |
| Unique Personhood | seed | 1-Human Mind |
| Unnecessary Pain | seed | 2-Change Process |

## Hanging Question

> "How do you distinguish pain from inaccurate beliefs (addressable) vs. pain that's just part of being a meaning-making creature (unavoidable)?"
