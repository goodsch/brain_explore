## Core Assumption: ADHD Brains Are Not Broken

> "ADHD is not a problem of knowing what to do; it is a problem of doing what you know." — Russell Barkley

IES is built on a foundational insight: **ADHD brains are interest-based, emotionally-driven, and connection-making machines.** The system must work WITH these traits, not against them.

Traditional knowledge tools assume:
- Users can start from a blank page
- Importance determines motivation
- Organization precedes retrieval
- Linear thinking is the default
- Memory works like a file cabinet

**IES assumes the opposite:** ADHD cognition requires multiple entry points, resonance-based capture, visible progress, non-judgmental status lifecycle, and external working memory.

## Six Core ADHD Cognitive Assumptions

### 1. Cannot Start from a Blank Page

**Research Source:** Russell Barkley - Executive Functions
**Key Insight:** "The policeman is asleep" — prefrontal cortex can't prioritize/inhibit without external structure

**ADHD Challenge:** Task initiation requires external triggers. A blank page paralyzes.

**How IES Addresses This:**
- **Dashboard Suggestions:** "Most Connected" and "Novel Concepts" provide starting points
- **Favorite Problems:** Feynman-style anchor questions (e.g., "How do people change?") create stable entry points
- **Recent Journeys:** "Continue where you left off" with breadcrumb trails
- **Mood-Based Access:** "Show me something exciting" or "Show me something calming" based on energy level
- **Serendipitous Discovery:** Random meaningful entry points via graph traversal

**Implementation:**
- `.worktrees/siyuan/ies/plugin/src/views/Dashboard.svelte` — Suggestion cards with clickable concepts
- `ies/backend/src/ies_backend/api/personal.py` — `/personal/sparks/unvisited` endpoint surfaces forgotten captures
- `library/graph/adhd_ontology.py` — `FavoriteProblem` entity type as persistent anchor

---

### 2. Interest-Based Nervous System (Not Importance-Based)

**Research Source:** Tamara Rosier - Your Brain's Not Broken
**Key Insight:** ADHD motivation follows emotional resonance, not objective value. Shame is a "malicious motivator."

**ADHD Challenge:** "This is important" doesn't generate energy. "This sparks something" does.

**How IES Addresses This:**
- **Resonance Signals:** 8 emotional tags (`curious`, `excited`, `surprised`, `moved`, `disturbed`, `unclear`, `connected`, `validated`) capture WHY something matters
- **Energy Levels:** Navigate by current capacity (low/medium/high), not forced engagement
- **Non-Judgmental Status:** Growth metaphor (`captured → exploring → anchored`) avoids shame triggers like "incomplete" or "draft"
- **Quick Capture:** `spark` entity type enables save-now-classify-later (zero friction)

**Implementation:**
- `.worktrees/siyuan/ies/plugin/src/types/blocks.ts` — `ResonanceSignal` enum (lines 85-94), `EnergyLevel` enum (lines 96-100)
- `.worktrees/siyuan/ies/plugin/src/views/Dashboard.svelte` — Energy filters (Low 🔋, Medium ⚡, High 🔥) and resonance filters
- `ies/backend/src/ies_backend/api/personal.py` — `/personal/sparks/by-resonance/{signal}` and `/personal/sparks/by-energy/{level}` endpoints
- `library/graph/adhd_graph_client.py` — `capture_spark()` method with resonance and energy metadata

**Example:**
```python
adhd_kg.capture_spark(
    title="Connection between EF and shame",
    content="Reading Barkley - realized shame blocks EF access",
    resonance_signal=ResonanceSignal.SURPRISED,
    energy_level=EnergyLevel.MEDIUM
)
```

### 3. Nonlinear/Associative Thinking Patterns

**Research Source:** Cognitive architecture research (spreading activation models)
**Key Insight:** ADHD minds make unexpected connections. Traditional hierarchical organization fights this strength.

**ADHD Challenge:** Forcing linear organization kills creativity. "Where does this go?" becomes a blocker.

**How IES Addresses This:**
- **Graph-Based Navigation:** Follow threads wherever they lead, not forced taxonomy
- **Multiple Relationship Types:** `resonates_with`, `sparked_by`, `led_to_discovery`, `addresses_problem` preserve associative connections
- **Thread Entities:** Capture exploration journeys across sessions without forcing premature categorization
- **Flow Mode:** Browse knowledge graph visually, clicking relationships to explore

**Implementation:**
- `library/graph/adhd_ontology.py` — `Thread` entity type preserves exploration paths
- `library/graph/adhd_ontology.py` — Relationship types (`sparked_by`, `led_to_discovery`, `addresses_problem`)
- `.worktrees/readest/readest/apps/readest-app/src/app/reader/components/flowpanel/RelationshipsSection.tsx` — Grouped relationship display
- `.worktrees/siyuan/ies/plugin/src/views/FlowMode.svelte` — Graph exploration interface

**Example Thread Node:**
```json
{
  "type": "thread",
  "title": "Understanding My Reactivity",
  "breadcrumbs": [
    {"node_id": "spark_therapy_001", "note": "Noticed pattern"},
    {"node_id": "spark_001", "note": "Maté resonated"},
    {"node_id": "concept_narrow_window", "note": "Connected!"}
  ]
}
```

### 4. Needs External Working Memory

**Research Source:** Gabor Maté - Scattered Minds
**Key Insight:** "Forgetting to remember the future" — implicit memory needs external capture system

**ADHD Challenge:** Great ideas evaporate before they can be recorded. If capture takes work, it won't happen.

**How IES Addresses This:**
- **Quick Capture Button:** One-click spark creation in SiYuan
- **Readest Highlights:** Select text → capture with automatic entity extraction
- **Capture Context Field:** "What were you doing when this struck you?" preserves implicit memory cues
- **Dual Status System:**
  - `capture_status` (AI processing): `raw → classified → processed`
  - `user_status` (engagement): `captured → exploring → anchored`

**Implementation:**
- `.worktrees/siyuan/ies/plugin/src/components/QuickCapture.svelte` — Zero-friction capture UI
- `.worktrees/siyuan/ies/plugin/src/types/blocks.ts` — `QuickCaptureMeta` interface with `capture_status` and `user_status`
- `ies/backend/src/ies_backend/services/capture_service.py` — `CaptureService` auto-extracts entities, adds metadata
- `.worktrees/siyuan/ies/plugin/src/utils/siyuan-structure.ts` — `/Daily/` folder for ephemeral captures

**Capture Without Classification:**
```
User: "Thought: Shame blocks EF access"
System: ✓ Saved as spark_042 (resonance: surprised, energy: medium)
        Auto-linked to: Executive Function, Shame
        Status: raw (ready for processing when you have time)
```

### 5. Insight Through Guided Questioning (Not Information Retrieval)

**Research Source:** Socratic method + cognitive behavioral therapy literature
**Key Insight:** ADHD minds excel at synthesis when given scaffolding. Generic prompts don't help.

**ADHD Challenge:** "Figure it out yourself" overwhelms. "What are the main categories here?" scaffolds.

**How IES Addresses This:**
- **9 Question Classes:** Schema-Probe, Boundary, Dimensional, Causal, Counterfactual, Anchor, Perspective-Shift, Meta-Cognitive, Reflective-Synthesis
- **Cognitive Hints:** Class-specific guidance (e.g., Schema-Probe: "Try listing the main categories, components, or buckets")
- **Response Starters:** Optional sentence starters reduce friction (e.g., "The main parts are...")
- **Mode-Specific Questions:** Learning mode uses Schema-Probe + Causal; Ideating uses Counterfactual + Perspective-Shift

**Implementation:**
- `.worktrees/siyuan/ies/plugin/src/views/ForgeMode.svelte` — `QUESTION_CLASS_HINTS` constant (lines 174-220) with hint text, prompts, response starters
- `ies/backend/src/ies_backend/api/question_engine.py` — Question generation pipeline with class tagging
- `ies/backend/src/ies_backend/schemas/question_engine.py` — `QuestionClass` enum, `APPROACH_TO_CLASSES` mapping

**Example Cognitive Hint (Schema-Probe):**
```
Hint: "This question asks you to surface hidden structure"
Prompt: "Try listing the main categories, components, or buckets"
Response Starter: "The main parts are..."
```

### 6. Understanding Through Movement (Exploration, Not Reading)

**Research Source:** Embodied cognition literature
**Key Insight:** ADHD minds understand by doing, not by passive consumption

**ADHD Challenge:** Reading linearly feels like trudging. Browsing, clicking, discovering = flow state.

**How IES Addresses This:**
- **Entity Overlay:** Click highlighted concepts in text → Flow panel opens
- **Relationship Traversal:** Click relationship → navigate to connected entity
- **Journey Breadcrumbs:** See where you've been (last 5 steps with dwell time)
- **Graph Exploration:** User-driven navigation, not forced linear reading

**Implementation:**
- `.worktrees/readest/readest/apps/readest-app/src/services/transformers/entity.ts` — Entity overlay transformer wraps entity names in clickable spans
- `.worktrees/readest/readest/apps/readest-app/src/app/reader/components/flowpanel/JourneyBreadcrumb.tsx` — Breadcrumb visualization with navigation
- `.worktrees/readest/readest/apps/readest-app/src/hooks/useEntityClick.ts` — Entity click → Flow panel event handling
- `.worktrees/readest/readest/apps/readest-app/src/app/reader/components/flowpanel/RelationshipsSection.tsx` — Clickable relationship badges

**Journey Capture:**
```
User clicks: Executive Function → IMPAIRED_BY → Shame → BLOCKED_BY → Anxiety
System tracks: 5 steps, total time 3m 42s, dwell per entity
Display: [EF] → [Shame] → [Anxiety] → [Fear] → [Avoidance] +2 more
```

## The 6-Dimension User Cognition Model

**Note:** Designed but not yet fully implemented in profile tracking.

IES personalizes questions and suggestions using a 6-dimension cognitive profile (0-1 scale):

| Dimension | Low End | High End | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|----------|---------|
| **structure_preference** | Open exploration | Scaffolded guidance | Determines template structure |
| **pace** | Slow/deep | Fast/broad | Adjusts question frequency |
| **ambiguity_tolerance** | Needs closure | Sits with uncertainty | Affects when to synthesize |
| **abstraction_level** | Concrete examples | Abstract concepts | Shapes question abstraction |
| **verification_need** | Intuitive trust | Evidence-based | Determines anchor question ratio |
| **novelty_preference** | Familiar patterns | Surprising connections | Affects suggestion diversity |

**Usage:**
- **Template Defaults:** High structure preference → more guided sections
- **Question Class Selection:** Low abstraction → more Anchor questions (concrete examples)
- **Mode Transition Triggers:** Low pace → longer time before suggesting mode switch

**Implementation Status:**
- Schema exists in backend
- Profile creation/retrieval works
- **Not yet validated:** Does profile actually update from conversations? Does it affect question generation?

**Future Work:**
- Automatic profile updates from session patterns
- A/B testing to validate profile impact on question quality

## Validation Evidence

**Phase 1 Results (10 sessions, 11 concepts):**
- ✅ Sessions feel like genuine thinking partnership (not chatbot Q&A)
- ✅ Resonance-based capture worked: sparks captured mid-session without derailing flow
- ✅ Energy-based navigation: low-energy suggestions surfaced consolidating concepts, high-energy introduced novelty
- ✅ Guided questions enabled insight: "Narrow Window" concept emerged from Schema-Probe + Boundary questions
- ✅ Journey breadcrumbs preserved context: could resume explorations across days

**ADHD User Feedback (not yet collected):**
- Does the system reduce cognitive load?
- Do multiple entry points prevent blank-page paralysis?
- Does resonance-based retrieval feel natural?
- Is the growth metaphor less shame-inducing?

## Design Principles (Derived from Assumptions)

1. **Resonance Over Importance** — Capture emotional engagement, not just taxonomic accuracy
2. **Multiple Entry Points** — Mood, question, energy, resonance, recency, serendipity
3. **Visible Progress** — Breadcrumb trails as treasure maps, not audit logs
4. **Low Friction, High Return** — Capture effortless, organization automatic, retrieval interest-based
5. **Context Preservation** — Save "why now?" alongside "what"
6. **Non-Judgmental Lifecycle** — Growth metaphor over productivity metrics
7. **Interest-Following Navigation** — Graph traversal feels like following curiosity

## What This Means for Future Development

**Any feature addition must answer:**
1. Does this work WITH ADHD cognition or against it?
2. Does this reduce cognitive load at decision points?
3. Does this provide multiple valid entry points?
4. Does this surface interesting connections or require manual organization?
5. Does this preserve context across interruptions?
6. Does this support non-linear navigation?

**Anti-Patterns to Avoid:**
- Forced categorization before capture
- Single "correct" way to find things
- Productivity metrics that trigger shame
- Linear-only navigation
- Blank-page starting points
