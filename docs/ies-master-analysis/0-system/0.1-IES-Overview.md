# 0.1 IES Overview

**Purpose:** This document defines the mission, philosophy, target users, and core architecture of the Intelligent Exploration System (IES).

**Date:** December 5, 2025
**Status:** Phase 2c Complete

---

## Mission and Purpose

The **Intelligent Exploration System (IES)** is a domain-agnostic thinking partnership tool that helps people explore complex knowledge domains with an AI partner that adapts to their unique cognitive patterns.

### The Core Insight

> "Instead of reading one book, you're reading a concept."

IES enables users to:
- **Navigate knowledge non-linearly** — Follow threads of interest across sources rather than sequential reading
- **Think WITH an AI partner** — Receive questions and guidance tailored to how YOU think, not generic prompts
- **Generate novel insights** — Surface new conceptualizations through guided exploration
- **Build personal knowledge** — Transform ephemeral thoughts into structured, connected understanding

### What Makes IES Different

**Traditional PKM Tools:**
- Linear reading and note-taking
- Manual tagging and organization
- Generic AI chat interfaces
- User does all the connecting

**IES:**
- Graph-based concept navigation
- ADHD-friendly capture and retrieval
- Personalized thinking partner questions
- System reveals patterns and connections
- Breadcrumb trails show your thinking journey
- Knowledge emerges through guided exploration

---

## Target User Cognitive Profile

IES is specifically designed for people with:

### ADHD and Executive Function Challenges
- **Interest-based nervous system** — Energy follows resonance, not importance
- **Context-dependent retrieval** — Need multiple entry points (mood, question, serendipity)
- **Low-friction capture** — If capture takes work, it won't happen
- **Visible progress** — Need to see the journey, not just the destination
- **Non-judgmental lifecycle** — Growth metaphor over productivity metrics

### Nonlinear Thinking Patterns
- **Associative exploration** — Connections emerge through browsing, not planning
- **Pattern recognition** — See relationships others miss
- **Deep dives** — Follow threads wherever they lead
- **Context switching** — Jump between topics without losing coherence

### Multiple Entry-Point Navigation
- **Mood-based access** — "Show me something exciting" or "Show me something calming"
- **Question-based access** — "What addresses this problem?"
- **Energy-based access** — Filter by energy level (low/medium/high)
- **Resonance-based access** — Find by emotional signal (curious, moved, unclear, etc.)
- **Recency-based access** — Recent visits bubble up

---

## System Philosophy: The Knowledge Lifecycle

IES uses a growth metaphor for knowledge development:

```
Ephemeral → Seed → Concept → Notebook → Graph → Synthesis
```

### 1. Ephemeral Capture (Raw Thoughts)
**Where:** Quick Capture in SiYuan or Readest
**State:** `raw` (just landed)
**Friction:** Zero — capture first, process later
**Storage:** `/Daily/` or `00_Inbox/`

### 2. Seed (Atomic Ideas)
**Where:** Seedlings folder with 7 subcategories
**State:** `classified` (AI added metadata)
**Types:** question, observation, moment, schema, contradiction, what_if, insight
**Storage:** `/Seedlings/{type}/`

### 3. Concept (Formalized Knowledge)
**Where:** Concepts folder or structured thinking session
**State:** `processed` (user decided placement)
**Integration:** Linked to domain graph, extractable to Neo4j
**Storage:** `/Concepts/` or `/Sessions/{mode}/`

### 4. Notebook (Structured Exploration)
**Where:** SiYuan documents with frontmatter
**Metadata:** `be_type`, `be_id`, `status`, `resonance`, `energy`
**Templates:** Mode-specific (Learning, Articulating, Planning, Ideating, Reflecting)

### 5. Graph (Connected Knowledge)
**Where:** Neo4j domain graph + personal graph
**Relationships:** MENTIONS, supports, contrasts_with, sparked_by, led_to_discovery
**Queries:** Entity search, relationship traversal, source lookup

### 6. Synthesis (Emergent Understanding)
**Where:** Journey analysis, pattern recognition
**Outcome:** Novel insights from exploration patterns
**Enrichment:** Concepts flow back into graph for next cycle

---

## The Three Modes: Capture → Dialogue → Flow

IES orchestrates three interlocking modes that form a virtuous cycle:

### Capture Mode (Ephemeral → Persistent)

**Purpose:** Zero-friction thought capture without derailing current task

**Entry Points:**
- Quick Capture button in SiYuan
- Highlight text in Readest → capture
- Voice notes (future)
- Browser extension (future)

**AI Role:**
- Extract entities and themes
- Suggest placements
- Add metadata automatically

**Output:**
- CaptureItem in queue with `raw` status
- Auto-linked to related concepts
- Ready for processing when user has time

**Status Flow:**
```
raw → classified → processed
```

### Dialogue Mode (Structured Thinking)

**Purpose:** AI-guided meaning extraction through personalized questions

**Entry Points:**
- ForgeMode in SiYuan
- 5 thinking modes: Learning, Articulating, Planning, Ideating, Reflecting
- Template-driven with section-by-section flow

**AI Role:**
- Ask mode-specific questions
- Adapt to user's 6-dimension cognitive profile
- Guide without directing
- Track question-response exchanges

**Output:**
- ThinkingSession with angles and breadcrumbs
- Session document in `/Sessions/{mode}/`
- Extracted entities ready for graph
- Transcript for later review

**Question Classes (9 types):**
- Schema-Probe, Boundary, Dimensional, Causal
- Counterfactual, Anchor, Perspective-Shift
- Meta-Cognitive, Reflective-Synthesis

### Flow Mode (Visual Graph Exploration)

**Purpose:** Non-linear knowledge navigation with thinking partner

**Entry Points:**
- Click entity in Readest overlay
- Search in SiYuan Flow Mode
- Dashboard suggestions
- Resume journey from breadcrumbs

**AI Role:**
- Generate thinking partner questions at decision points
- Surface unexpected connections
- Explain concepts via reframes (metaphors, analogies)
- Track exploration path as breadcrumbs

**Output:**
- FlowSession with visited nodes/edges
- Journey breadcrumbs with dwell time
- Synthesis of insights from path
- Suggestions for next exploration

**Data Flow:**
```
User browses → AI asks questions → User responds
→ Journey captured → Patterns emerge → Suggestions improve
```

## How the Modes Interlock

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Capture: Raw thought] --> B[Dialogue: Extract meaning]
    B --> C[Graph: Add to knowledge]
    C --> D[Flow: Explore connections]
    D --> E[Insight: Novel discovery]
    E --> A

    D --> F[Capture: New spark]
    F --> B
```

**The Virtuous Cycle:**

1. **Capture** surfaces raw thoughts with minimal friction
2. **Dialogue** extracts structured meaning through guided questions
3. Structured thoughts become **concepts** in the graph
4. **Flow** exploration reveals unexpected connections
5. Connections spark **new insights**
6. Insights get **captured**, restarting the cycle at a deeper level

**Personalization Layer:**
- User's cognitive profile informs Dialogue questions
- Journey patterns inform Flow suggestions
- Resonance signals prioritize Capture queue
- Energy levels determine appropriate entry points

## System Principles

### 1. Domain-Agnostic Design
IES works across ANY knowledge domain:
- Scientific research
- Legal analysis
- Creative projects
- Business strategy
- Learning any subject

**Current validation domains:**
- Psychology (ADHD, therapy, neuroscience)
- Productivity and learning
- Philosophy and systems thinking

### 2. ADHD-Friendly by Design
- **Zero-friction capture** — Capture now, process later
- **Multiple entry points** — Mood, question, energy, resonance, recency
- **Visible progress** — Breadcrumb trails show journey
- **Non-judgmental lifecycle** — Growth metaphor over productivity
- **Energy-aware** — Navigate by current energy level

### 3. Personalization Through Observation
- **6-dimension cognitive profile** — structure, pace, ambiguity, abstraction, verification, novelty
- **Pattern recognition** — System learns how you think by observing
- **Adaptive questions** — Questions match your thinking style
- **Journey analysis** — Exploration patterns inform suggestions

### 4. Thinking Partnership, Not Chatbot
- **AI as thinking partner** — Asks clarifying questions, surfaces connections
- **User-driven navigation** — You choose where to go
- **Guidance without direction** — System suggests, never dictates
- **Breadcrumb documentation** — System captures your thinking path

### 5. Knowledge Emergence
- **Novel insights surface** — From structure, not just content
- **Connections reveal meaning** — Graph relationships generate understanding
- **Cycles deepen understanding** — Each pass enriches the next
- **Personal + domain knowledge** — Both graphs enrich each other
