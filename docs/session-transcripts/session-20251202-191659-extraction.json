    "key_insights": [
      "Three distinct nervous system configurations exist: hypervigilant/defended, shutdown/unavailable, and regulated/available",
      "Authentic presence combines both settledness and aliveness - it's not just the absence of hypervigilance",
      "Similar-looking 'calm' states can be fundamentally different - one alive and available, one numb and withdrawn",
      "The shift from impression management to authenticity involves a bodily settlement as vigilance releases"
    ],
    "open_questions": [
      "What exactly does 'available' mean in regulated aliveness, and available for what?",
      "What creates the conditions for genuine movement toward regulated aliveness?",
      "Is therapeutic change about teaching the nervous system something new or helping it remember something it already knows?"
