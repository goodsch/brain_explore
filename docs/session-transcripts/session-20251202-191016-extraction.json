    "key_insights": [
      "Grief can be understood as evidence of connection rather than mere absence",
      "The quality of grief itself serves as a compass - tender grief that connects to love indicates acceptance, while flat disconnected grief indicates resignation",
      "Resignation often masquerades as acceptance, particularly around grief where cultural pressure exists to 'move on'",
      "Loss may reveal the true nature and depth of love that existed"
    ],
    "open_questions": [
      "How does understanding love through the lens of loss change our experience of present relationships?",
      "What is the nature of relationships - do they require physical presence or persist through other means?",
      "How can we better distinguish between genuine acceptance and resignation masquerading as acceptance?"
    ],
    "threads_explored": [
      "The paradoxical aliveness present when genuinely meeting grief",
      "Grief as a pathway to understanding love rather than something to overcome",
      "The distinction between acceptance that maintains connection and resignation that severs it",
      "How the absence created by loss reveals the fullness of what was present"
