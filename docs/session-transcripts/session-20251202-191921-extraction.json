    "key_insights": [
      "The nervous system acts as a gatekeeper that controls access to cognitive and creative resources",
      "Capacity may be about access rather than innate ability - intelligence and creativity can be locked away by dysregulation",
      "Therapy shifts from creating new capacities to restoring access to existing ones",
      "This reframes therapeutic hope from questioning if change is possible to identifying what conditions enable emergence"
    ],
    "open_questions": [
      "What specific conditions unlock access to locked-away capacities?",
      "How does the process of restoration actually unfold as regulation improves?",
      "What determines timing and readiness for capacity to re-emerge?"
