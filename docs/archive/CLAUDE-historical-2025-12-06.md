# brain_explore — Intelligent Exploration System

*A domain-agnostic tool for structured thinking, understanding, connecting, and researching across any knowledge domain*

## What This Is

A four-layer system that enables people to think WITH an AI partner who adapts to their unique thinking style while exploring complex knowledge domains:

1. **Layer 1: Knowledge Graph Creation** — Pre-processing and ingestion pipeline
   - Ingests domain materials (texts, research, conceptual frameworks)
   - Creates rich knowledge graphs with entities and relationships
   - Domain-agnostic: can ingest and structure any knowledge domain
   - *Current corpus:* 179 books in Calibre library, 10 indexed with entities (~300 entities) — used for system validation
   - *See:* `books/BOOK-CATALOG.md` for complete categorized inventory

2. **Layer 2: Backend Services** — APIs for graph, dialogue, journey tracking, content capture
   - Graph API: entity search, exploration, sources, relationship traversal
   - Session API: structured thinking dialogue with mode-specific behaviors
   - Journey API: breadcrumb tracking and persistence across sessions
   - Profile system: 6-dimension cognitive profile for personalization
   - Question engine: thinking partner questions at decision points

3. **Layer 3: SiYuan Plugin (Processing Hub)** — Dashboard and structured thinking modes
   - Dashboard: stats, suggestions, recent journeys, capture queue
   - 5 Thinking Modes: Learning, Articulating, Planning, Ideating, Reflecting
   - Flow Mode: graph exploration with grouped relationship display
   - Quick Capture: content processing with entity extraction

4. **Layer 4: Readest Integration (Reading Interface)** — E-book reader with flow exploration
   - Split-panel view: source text + entity panel
   - Text selection → entity lookup → relationship exploration
   - Breadcrumb journey capture during reading sessions
   - Seamless toggle between reading mode and flow exploration

**The Virtuous Cycle:** Layer 2 dialogue reveals thinking patterns that personalize Layer 3/4 exploration. Exploration surfaces new concepts and connections. The thinking path becomes formalized concepts that enrich Layer 1. Each cycle deepens both domain understanding and personalization.

**For complete project status, see:** `docs/COMPREHENSIVE-PROJECT-STATUS.md`

**Phase 1 Achievement Summary:**
- ✅ **10/10 validation sessions completed** — System validated using personal therapy/growth exploration
- ✅ **11+ concepts extracted and formalized** — Demonstrated the full thinking → extraction pipeline
- ✅ **Complete concept connection map** — Hierarchical relationships documented in CONNECTIONS.md
- ✅ **Extraction pipeline proven end-to-end** — Session → Transcript → Extraction → Formalization → Commit
- ✅ **Core hypothesis validated** — Personalized dialogue patterns directly affect concept discovery
- ✅ **IES backend (94/94 tests passing)** — All APIs production-ready including Flow Mode capture → thinking → flow pipeline
- ✅ **Calibre integration complete** — 179 books, auto-ingestion daemon running

**Phase 2a Validation Summary:**
- ✅ **5/5 exploration sessions completed** — CLI tool navigates knowledge graph reliably
- ✅ **Exploration surfaces unexpected relationships** — Graph reveals multidimensional concept connections (3-15 per exploration)
- ✅ **Thinking partner questions enhance navigation** — Claude-generated questions deepen reflection without interrupting flow
- ✅ **Layer 3 creates different thinking experience** — User-driven navigation (graph) complements AI-driven dialogue (Layer 2)
- ✅ **Novel insights emerge from structure** — Graph relationships surface discoveries dialogue alone wouldn't find
- ✅ **Complete validation criteria met** — All quantitative and qualitative success measures achieved

**Phase 1 Results:**

**Active Application: Personal Growth Framework**
*(Ongoing personal project using this system — demonstrates capability, not system purpose)*

Through 10 validation sessions, a personal framework emerged exploring how humans construct meaning within constraints:
1. **Narrow Window** — The window is universal, not pathology; constraint enables meaning
2. **Acceptance vs. Resignation** — Distinction is aliveness/energy, not external form
3. **Grief as Acceptance** — Loss reveals love; grief-with-presence preserves connection
4. **Metabolization of Difficulty** — Process by which pain becomes capacity (not elimination)
5. **Shame as Non-Acceptance** — Blocker to metabolization; prevents movement toward presence
6. **Authentic Presence** — Outcome of shame metabolization and nervous system re-regulation
7. **Nervous System Configurations** — Three states (hypervigilance, shutdown, regulated aliveness) determine capacity
8. **Nervous System as Gatekeeper** — Capacity emerges when nervous system is accessed
9. **Superpower in Weakness** — Adaptive trauma response becomes strength when metabolized
10. **Window as Condition for Depth** — Constraint itself enables meaning, beauty, presence

**Pipeline Validated:**
- Session → Transcript: ✅ Auto-saved by session runner
- Transcript → Extraction: ✅ Backend ExtractionService API works flawlessly
- Extraction → Interpretation: ✅ Manual concept document creation from key insights
- Concepts → Connections: ✅ CONNECTIONS.md maps relationships and threads
- Connections → Commit: ✅ Git history captures complete evolution

**What Learned:**
- The IES system (Layers 1 & 2) successfully creates genuine thinking partnership
- Personalized dialogue (informed by profile system) surfaces valuable conceptualizations
- The extraction → formalization pipeline works end-to-end
- One person's thinking patterns, explored with adaptive questions, generates meaningful insights
- Concepts that emerge are testable, relatable, and applicable to real decisions

**Roadmap:**
- **Phase 0 (COMPLETE):** Configuration stabilization removed 40% meta-work overhead
- **Phase 1 (COMPLETE):** Core hypothesis proven — Layers 1 & 2 work; extraction pipeline validated with 11 concepts
- **Phase 2a (COMPLETE):** Layer 3 CLI validation — CLI exploration tool proven with 5 validation sessions
- **Phase 2b (COMPLETE):** Visual interfaces — Readest reading interface + SiYuan plugin dashboard (both MVPs complete)
- **Phase 2c (65% COMPLETE):** Calibre integration + Entity overlay + Reframe API + Template API + ForgeMode
- **Phase 3+:** Cross-app sync, journey analysis, additional domains

## How to Work Here (Phase 2c+)

**Phase 2c is in progress:** Integrating Reframe Layer + Thinking Template Schema + SiYuan Document Structure to close critical gaps preventing real-world usage.

### Worktree Organization

**The master branch contains shared backend and documentation only.** Feature work happens in separate worktrees with their own TASK.md files:

| Worktree Location | Branch | Purpose | Task File |
|------------------|--------|---------|-----------|
| `.` (root) | `master` | Backend APIs, Layer 1/2, shared docs | None (master has no TASK.md) |
| `.worktrees/readest/` | `feature/readest-integration` | Layer 4 Reading Interface | `TASK.md` in worktree |
| `.worktrees/siyuan/` | `feature/siyuan-evolution` | Layer 3 Processing Hub | `TASK.md` in worktree |
| `.worktrees/readest-critique/` | `feature/readest-critique` | Readest Four-Agent Pressure Test | `TASK.md` in worktree |
| `.worktrees/ux-dev/` | `feature/ux-development` | Unified Design System (SiYuan + Readest visual consistency) | `TASK.md` in worktree |

**Working in Worktrees:**
- Each worktree is a separate directory with its own branch checked out
- Use `cd` to switch between worktrees, NOT `git checkout`
- Each worktree has its own `TASK.md` with specific objectives for that feature
- The root (master branch) intentionally has NO `TASK.md` - it's backend/docs only
- See `docs/WORKTREE-GUIDE.md` for complete reference

### Where to Start

**For New Session (Read First):**
1. `docs/SYSTEM-DESIGN.md` — How the system works end-to-end (operational reference)
2. Check git status and recent commits to understand current state

**Understand What Was Accomplished:**
1. Read `docs/session-notes.md` — Top section summarizes all 10 sessions and Phase 1 completion
2. Review `/therapy/Track_1_Human_Mind/CONNECTIONS.md` — See the therapeutic framework that emerged
3. Review the 11 concept documents in `/therapy/Track_1_Human_Mind/` — Each concept is a formalized insight
4. Check git log — `git log --oneline` shows progression of sessions and concept extraction

**Key Resources:**
- `docs/SYSTEM-DESIGN.md` — Operational reference: how all layers integrate, critical gaps, SiYuan AST structure (4 modes, 9 question classes)
- `docs/PROJECT-OVERVIEW.md` — Complete vision and design rationale, IES Question Engine preview
- `docs/five-agent-synthesis.md` — Deep analysis of why architecture decisions were made
- `docs/PHASE-1-WORKFLOW.md` — Phase 1 operational guide (for reference if running additional exploration sessions)
- `IES AST SiYuan structure.md` — Tracking document for 20 SiYuan notebook pages defining AST mode architecture
- `docs/IES question engine expansion.md` — Complete Question Engine specification (referenced by SiYuan documents)

- Section-by-section flow with AI behavior specifications
- Graph mapping rules (create entities, link relationships on completion)
- Starting with: Learning (Mechanism Map) + Articulating (Clarify Intuition)

**3. SiYuan Document Structure** — ADHD-friendly personal knowledge organization
- Folder hierarchy: `/Daily/`, `/Insights/`, `/Threads/`, `/Favorite Problems/`, `/Sessions/`
- Frontmatter standard: `be_type`, `be_id`, `status`, `resonance`, `energy`, concept links
- Quick Capture → Daily log flow (low friction)
- Promotion flow: Daily spark → `/Insights/` (updates backend status)

**Implementation Strategy:**
- Phase 1 (Sequential): Single agent defines shared interfaces
- Phase 2 (Parallel): 4 agents work independently on: Backend Reframe Service, Backend Template Engine, SiYuan Plugin Structure, Readest Reframes Tab
- Phase 3 (Sequential): Integration and end-to-end testing

**For Complete Design:**
- `docs/plans/2025-12-04-reframe-template-integration-design.md` — Full specification with API endpoints, schemas, implementation plan, and success criteria
- `docs/plans/2025-12-04-execution-plan.md` — Tactical execution plan using Codex and Gemini CLI for parallel implementation (Phase 1: interfaces, Phase 2: parallel workstreams, Phase 3: integration)

**Reframe UI Components (Implemented):**
- `.worktrees/readest/readest/apps/readest-app/src/app/reader/components/flowpanel/ReframesSection.tsx` — Readest Flow panel Reframes tab (React/TypeScript)
- `.worktrees/siyuan/ies/plugin/src/components/ReframesTab.svelte` — SiYuan plugin Reframes tab (Svelte)
- Both components integrate with backend `/reframes` API for concept reframe retrieval, generation, and feedback voting
- Features: Type-grouped reframe display (metaphor, analogy, story, experiment, question), on-demand generation, thumbs up/down feedback

**Entity Overlay Flow Mode (Dec 4)** — Next Phase 2c workstream: Auto-annotated entity highlighting in book text
- Backend: `GET /graph/entities/by-book/{hash}` endpoint returns all entities mentioned in a book (sorted by frequency)
- Frontend: Content transformer wraps entity names in styled `<span>` elements for type-based highlighting
- UI: Entity type filter controls show/hide Concept/Person/Theory/Framework/Assessment
- Click interaction: Clicking highlighted entity opens flow panel with entity connections
- Full implementation plan: `docs/plans/2025-12-04-entity-overlay-flow-mode.md` (6-task TDD plan with code examples)

**Remaining Critical Gaps (Deferred):**

3. **Book Library Now Accessible** (Gap addressed Dec 4) — Calibre integration design provides single source of truth for book catalog
   - Solution: Calibre library as canonical book source with calibre_id as universal identifier
   - Backend: Book catalog API, entity lookup by calibre_id, book cover fetching
   - Frontend: Readest library browser with book selection
   - Ingestion: Multi-pass pipeline (structure → relationships → enrichment) with status tracking
   - See: `docs/plans/2025-12-04-calibre-integration-design.md` for complete architecture

4. **Cross-App Continuity Missing** — Readest and SiYuan don't share state. Can't resume reading session from SiYuan or resume exploration from Readest.

5. **Journey Value Loop Not Closed** — Journeys are captured but never analyzed for patterns. Patterns not used to personalize suggestions or improve thinking partner questions.

**For Gap Analysis:**
- `docs/PLANNING-GAPS-AND-QUESTIONS.md` — Comprehensive gap analysis with detailed technical review
- `docs/COMPREHENSIVE-PROJECT-STATUS.md` — Complete technical status of all four layers
- `docs/plans/2025-12-04-calibre-integration-design.md` — Calibre integration: single source of truth for book catalog and entity indexing

### If Running Additional Exploration Sessions

The Phase 1 pipeline is fully documented and proven. To run additional sessions:

1. Reference `docs/PHASE-1-WORKFLOW.md` (complete operational guide)
2. Verify backend is healthy: `curl http://localhost:8081/health`
3. Verify Docker services running: `docker compose ps`
4. Run: `python scripts/run-session.py --topic "Your question"`
5. Follow extraction and formalization steps documented in PHASE-1-WORKFLOW.md
6. Append results to CONNECTIONS.md
7. Commit with clear message

**Project Memory:**
- `docs/PHASE-1-WORKFLOW.md` = Operational guide for sessions (proven, reusable)
- `docs/session-notes.md` = Complete session history and reflection
- `/therapy/Track_1_Human_Mind/` = All extracted concepts and connections
- Git history = Complete evolution of work
- Together these form complete, searchable project memory

```

**Architecture Alignment:**
- **Layer 1** = Knowledge graph + ingestion pipeline in `library/` and `books/`
- **Layer 2** = Backend services (API, dialogue, profile) in `ies/backend/`
- **Layer 3** = SiYuan plugin in `.worktrees/siyuan/` (processing hub, dashboard)
- **Layer 4** = Readest integration in `.worktrees/readest/` (reading interface)
- **Active Application** = `therapy/` directory (personal growth framework — ongoing project)

**Docker Infrastructure Stack:**

The `docker-compose.yml` orchestrates five services supporting all four layers:

1. **Qdrant** (Vector Store - Layer 1)
   - Container: `brain_explore_qdrant`
   - Ports: 6333 (REST API), 6334 (gRPC)
   - Purpose: Embedding storage for entity and concept search
   - Data: `./data/qdrant`

2. **Neo4j** (Graph Database - Layer 1)
   - Container: `brain_explore_neo4j`
   - Ports: 7474 (Browser), 7687 (Bolt protocol)
   - Auth: neo4j/brainexplore
   - APOC plugin enabled for advanced graph operations
   - Data: `./data/neo4j`

3. **Calibre Web** (Book Catalog - Layer 1)
   - Container: `brain_explore_calibre`
   - Port: 8083 (Web UI)
   - Purpose: Single source of truth for book library (179 books)
   - Features: Auto-import from `/downloads`, metadata management
   - Library: `./calibre/library` (SQLite + epub/pdf files)
   - Ingest: `./calibre/ingest` (incoming books directory)

4. **SiYuan** (Processing Hub - Layer 3)
   - Container: `brain_explore_siyuan`
   - Port: 6806 (Web UI)
   - Purpose: Personal knowledge management with IES plugin integration
   - **Workspace:** `./data/siyuan/workspace`
   - **Plugins:** `./data/siyuan/workspace/data/plugins/` (install IES plugin here)
   - **Themes:** `./data/siyuan/workspace/data/themes/`
   - **Notebooks:** `./data/siyuan/workspace/data/` (each notebook is a folder)
   - Auth bypass enabled for development
   - Note: Plugin runs client-side, communicates with backend via forwardProxy

5. **Readest** (Reading Interface - Layer 4)
   - Run locally: `cd .worktrees/readest/readest/apps/readest-app && pnpm dev`
   - Port: 3000 (dev server)
   - Purpose: E-book reader with entity overlay and flow exploration
   - Note: Not containerized — Tauri desktop app runs better natively for development

**Service Dependencies:**
- Backend APIs (Layer 2) run on host at port 8081, connect to Qdrant + Neo4j
- SiYuan plugin uses forwardProxy to call backend APIs from browser context
- Readest calls backend APIs directly via HTTP (localhost:8081 or network IP)
- Calibre integration uses `calibre_id` as universal book identifier across all systems

**Quick Start:**
```bash
docker compose up -d             # Start all 5 services
docker compose ps                # Check service status
docker compose down              # Stop all services
```

### Supporting References

**Constraints & Scope:**
- `docs/parking-lot.md` — Future features (what NOT to work on in Phase 1)
- `CLAUDE.md` (this file) — Quick reference and structure guide

**Technical Setup:**
- `ies/backend/README.md` — Backend API setup and configuration
- `docker-compose.yml` — Full infrastructure stack (5 services: Qdrant, Neo4j, Calibre, SiYuan, Readest)

## The Parking Lot

**Explicitly Deferred to Phase 2c+:**
- **Multi-domain framework generalization** — Apply thinking partnership system to other knowledge domains beyond therapy
- **Advanced profile system (8 dimensions)** — Expand user profile complexity for finer personalization
- **Question engine (8 inquiry approaches)** — Formalize diverse questioning methodologies
- **Post-processing pipeline** — Enrich graph with Phase 1 conceptual frameworks and bidirectional linking
- **Plugin model selection** — Backend accepts model param, plugin passes settings.chatModel (currently decorative UI)
- **MCP server integration** — Connect system to Claude via Model Context Protocol
- **n8n integration** — Workflow automation for concept extraction and formalization
- **Synapse component ports** — Migrate components to alternative front-end frameworks

**Phase 2b Complete:**
- ✅ Readest reading interface (Layer 4) - Flow mode, entity panel, breadcrumb capture
- ✅ SiYuan plugin dashboard (Layer 3) - 5 thinking modes, flow exploration, quick capture

**Phase 2c Focus:**
- User testing of complete four-layer system
- Refinement based on real-world usage
- ADHD-friendly ontology design (research complete in `.interleaved-thinking/`)
- Personal growth framework development (ongoing application)
- IES AST Mode implementation (specifications complete Dec 5, SiYuan notebook created)

**Rule:** Additional domains (Phase 3+) wait until core system is refined through real usage.

**ADHD-Focused Research:**
Research completed (Dec 3) on ADHD-friendly ontology design, drawing from:
- Russell Barkley (executive function deficits)
- Tamara Rosier (interest-based nervous system)
- Gabor Maté (emotional resonance as retrieval cue)
- Tiago Forte (capture what resonates, 12 favorite problems)
- Cognitive architecture literature (conceptual spaces, spreading activation)

Key recommendations in `.interleaved-thinking/final-answer.md`:
- **Resonance over importance** — Capture emotional engagement, not just taxonomic accuracy
- **Multiple entry points** — Mood-based, question-based, serendipitous discovery
- **Visible progress** — Breadcrumb trails as treasure maps, not audit logs
- **Low friction capture** — `spark` type for unprocessed resonance
- **Non-judgmental lifecycle** — Growth metaphor (`captured → exploring → anchored`)
- **New entity types:** `spark`, `favorite_problem`, `thread`, `insight`
- **New relationships:** `sparked_by`, `led_to_discovery`, `addresses_problem`

## The Four-Layer Thinking Partnership Cycle

This is how the system creates value through personalized thinking partnership:

**Layer 2 → Layers 3/4 Personalization:**
- Backend dialogue services reveal HOW someone thinks (patterns, preferences, perspectives)
- This personalization profile informs Layer 3/4 exploration guidance
- Questions aren't generic—they're shaped by revealed patterns

**Layers 3/4 Exploration → Concept Discovery:**
- Reading (Layer 4) or dashboard exploration (Layer 3) with thinking partner questions
- User generates novel conceptualizations through guided thinking
- Exploration path and thinking artifacts documented as breadcrumbs
- Breadcrumbs become raw material for extracting formalized concepts

**Concept Formalization → Layer 1 Enrichment:**
- Extracted concepts formalized and added to knowledge graph (Layer 1)
- Next session starts with enriched knowledge and refined personalization
- The cycle deepens: better profile → more personalized guidance → deeper generation

**Phase 1 validated this cycle** with 10 dialogue sessions demonstrating the full extraction pipeline. **Phase 2b built the complete interface** for reading and exploration.

## Key Concept: Domain-Agnostic Thinking Tool

This project builds a **general intelligent exploration system** (Layers 1-4) for structured thinking, understanding, connecting, and researching across ANY knowledge domain.

- **Layer 1** (Knowledge Graph) — Domain-agnostic ingestion and graph creation
- **Layer 2** (Backend Services) — Domain-agnostic APIs for graph, dialogue, journey, capture
- **Layer 3** (SiYuan Plugin) — Domain-agnostic processing hub and structured thinking
- **Layer 4** (Readest) — Domain-agnostic reading interface with flow exploration

**Current Application Domains:**
- **Multi-domain corpus** — 114 books across 8 categories (ADHD, psychology, neuroscience, productivity, learning, relationships, philosophy, systems thinking); used for system validation
- **Personal growth framework** — Active ongoing project (the 11 concepts); demonstrates extraction pipeline
- **See:** `books/BOOK-CATALOG.md` for complete categorized inventory

**The system is NOT:**
- A therapy tool
- A psychology-specific application
- Limited to any single domain

**The system IS:**
- A thinking partnership tool for any knowledge domain
- An intelligent exploration system for structured research
- A personal knowledge capture and connection system
- Applicable to: scientific research, legal analysis, creative projects, business strategy, learning any subject

## Working Style

**Claude acts as project manager.** Always choose the optimal next step in development rather than asking what to do next. Present the decision and proceed; user will confirm or redirect if needed.

- Don't ask "what would you like to work on?"
- Do identify the highest-value next action and take it
- Explain briefly why this is the optimal next step
- Ask for confirmation to proceed before doing so

## Architecture: ADHD-Friendly Personal Knowledge Layer

**Recent Changes (Dec 6):**
- **✅ Backend Services Pressure Test Complete (Dec 6)** — Systematic four-agent analysis of all backend Layer 2 services reveals critical gaps despite 94/94 passing tests:
  - **12 Analysis Documents Created:**

    - `docs/ANALYSIS-CROSS-APP-INTEGRATION-2025-12-06.md` — Cross-App Integration Technical Details
    - Plus 3 additional component-specific analyses
  - **Pressure Test Queue Status:** `docs/PRESSURE-TEST-PLAN.md` updated - Session & Dialogue Services ✅ COMPLETE, Journey & Breadcrumb Services ✅ COMPLETE
  - **Critical Findings Summary:**
    - **Session Services (Grade D+):** 23 bugs (5 critical), zero test coverage on chat/extraction endpoints, sessions lost on restart, no resumption flow, profile learning code has TODOs
    - **Personal Graph (Grade C+):** Complete library layer bypass (imports backend `Neo4jClient` instead of `ADHDKnowledgeGraph`), zero test coverage (0/94 tests), personal-domain graph bridge missing (concept_ids stored as strings not relationships), 14 bugs including race condition in promote_to_insight()
    - **Journey Services (Grade B+):** Three parallel breadcrumb systems (Journey, Thinking, Flow) with no integration between them, missing thinking→journey promotion, no SiYuan sync implementation
    - **Reframe & Template (Grade C):** No caching despite docs claiming it exists, feedback votes collected but never used for learning (virtuous cycle broken), 15 bugs including no API key validation at startup, cost runaway risk (no rate limiting)
    - **Cross-App Integration (Grade D):** Readest journeys saved to localStorage only (never synced to backend), SiYuan Dashboard can't see Readest exploration, user-created concepts invisible in Readest entity overlay, knowledge graph fragmentation (session concepts and book entities are separate universes)
  - **Impact:** Infrastructure exists and tests pass, but services don't deliver on core principles (thinking partnership, ADHD-friendly design, virtuous cycle, cross-app continuity)
- **Knowledge Graph Pressure Test Analysis (Dec 6)** — Four-agent critical analysis reveals fundamental architectural fragmentation (Grade: D+, 1.8/4.0):
  - `docs/ANALYSIS-KNOWLEDGE-GRAPH-2025-12-06.md` — Complete Layer 1 evaluation with 23 bugs identified (5 critical, 8 high, 7 medium, 3 low)
  - **Critical Finding #1:** THREE disconnected Neo4j clients (`KnowledgeGraph`, `ADHDKnowledgeGraph`, `GraphService`) with schema drift and inconsistent patterns
  - **Critical Finding #2:** Schema collapses 14 entity types → 4 types during ingestion; rich ADHD ontology (Person, Framework, Method) all become generic "Concept"
  - **Critical Finding #3:** Personal-Domain graph bridge completely missing — no relationships connecting user sparks to indexed books, breaking virtuous cycle
  - **Critical Finding #4:** Cypher injection vulnerability via f-string label interpolation in `neo4j_client.py:50`
  - **Critical Finding #5:** Silent 70-90% content discard — ingestion limits books to 50 chunks (~25 pages), discarding most content without warning
  - **ADHD Features Status:** Beautiful research-backed design (8 resonance signals, 3 energy levels, non-judgmental lifecycle) but barely integrated — no UI for threads, no energy-based API queries, favorite problems schema unused
  - **Pressure Test Queue Updated:** Knowledge Graph analysis complete; Backend Services complete; remaining: Backend Question Engine
  - **Impact:** Layer 1 needs architectural unification before Layer 3/4 features can deliver on principles
- **IES Master Analysis Documentation** — Comprehensive 28-document system reference generated from code analysis:
  - `docs/ies-master-analysis/` — Complete IES system documentation in 7 sections with dependency-ordered content
  - **Implementation plan:** `docs/plans/2025-12-05-master-analysis-agent-plan.md` — 4-phase execution strategy (Foundation → Core → Technical → Validation)
  - **Phase 1 Foundation outputs (3 documents created):**
    - `0-system/0.1-IES-Overview.md` — Mission, ADHD cognitive profile, three modes (Capture/Dialogue/Flow), knowledge lifecycle (ephemeral→seed→concept→notebook→graph→synthesis)
    - `3-schemas/3.1-Seed-Schema.md` — Atomic idea schema with 7 types (question, insight, observation, moment, schema, contradiction, what_if), dual status systems (capture_status: raw→classified→processed, user_status: captured→exploring→anchored), TypeScript and Python schema definitions
    - Additional schemas pending: Block Schema, Notebook Schema, Entity Graph Schema
  - **Purpose:** Provides canonical reference documentation verified against actual codebase implementation, supports AI agent context and developer onboarding
  - **Structure follows:** Master list.md requirements with sections for system overview, cognition model, mode specs, schemas, architecture, visuals, audits, and meta-documentation
  - **Key innovations documented:** ADHD-friendly navigation (energy/resonance filters), non-judgmental lifecycle (growth metaphor), personalized thinking partnership (9 question classes), virtuous knowledge cycle

**Recent Changes (Dec 5-6):**
- **Tauri Dynamic Import Pattern (Dec 6)** — Fixed static Tauri imports breaking web mode across auth and settings:
  - `.worktrees/readest/readest/apps/readest-app/src/app/auth/utils/nativeAuth.ts`: Removed static `import { type as osType }`, replaced with dynamic `await import('@tauri-apps/plugin-os')` inside `authWithSafari()` function (lines 13-14)
  - `.worktrees/readest/readest/apps/readest-app/src/app/auth/utils/appleIdAuth.ts`: Same pattern in `getAppleIdAuth()` function (lines 27-28)
  - `.worktrees/readest/readest/apps/readest-app/src/app/reader/components/KOSyncSettings.tsx`: Dynamic import inside `getOsName()` async function with fallback to `getOSPlatform()` for web (lines 91-92)
  - **Problem:** Static Tauri imports execute module-level code requiring Tauri APIs, causing crashes when running in browser context (`pnpm dev` for web debugging)
  - **Solution:** Dynamic imports `await import('@tauri-apps/plugin-os')` only execute when functions are called in actual Tauri environment
  - **Pattern:** Move Tauri imports inside async functions that only run in Tauri context, with graceful fallback for web
  - **Impact:** Readest can now run in both Tauri (desktop/mobile apps) and web modes without crashes
  - **Related:** Follows same pattern as `nativeAppService.ts` (commit 51b8ee3) and `environment.ts` (commit 7c9ca46) for Tauri/web compatibility
- **✅ Readest Remediation Complete (Dec 5-6)** — All critical bugs fixed, core UX features implemented:
  - `.worktrees/readest/TASK.md`: Status updated to REMEDIATION COMPLETE (Dec 5-6)
  - **BUG-R01 Fix:** Event listener memory leak resolved with proper cleanup (FoliateViewer.tsx lines 102-113)
    - Implemented `iframeDocsRef` Map tracking for all iframe documents and their event listeners
    - Added cleanup function in useEffect to remove all 9 event listener types (keydown, keyup, mousedown, mouseup, click, wheel, touchstart, touchmove, touchend)
    - Prevents memory accumulation during book navigation and page rendering
  - **All Priority 1 bugs resolved:** BUG-R01 (memory leak), BUG-R02 (regex performance), BUG-R03/R04 (AbortController), BUG-R05 (singleton stale config)
  - **All Priority 2 UX features complete:** Entity highlights clickable, question response input, journey breadcrumbs visible, state persistence
  - **Priority 3 design system integration:** IES design system imported, entity colors aligned, typography applied
  - **Success criteria met:** Thinking partnership (questions interactive), ADHD-friendly (entity overlay), virtuous cycle (journey tracking), design cohesion (IES system)
  - **Impact:** Readest Layer 4 now production-ready for user testing
- **Session API Refinements** — Enhanced session processing for improved entity extraction and schema alignment:
  - `ies/backend/src/ies_backend/api/session.py`: Updated endpoint documentation and type hints (200 lines)

  - Integration: ForgeMode session completion flow uses updated schemas for concept extraction wizard
  - Fields: `doc_id`, `entities_extracted` (count), `summary` (key insights), plus detailed entity/insight lists for UI display
- **SiYuan Plugin Structure Refinements** — Enhanced domain-agnostic configuration and session document metadata:
  - `.worktrees/siyuan/ies/plugin/src/utils/siyuan-structure.ts`: Updated session document creation with ShapingBlockMeta support (769 lines)
  - **10-folder structure complete:** Added `/System/` folder with Templates and Example_Notes subfolders (Package's 07_System)
  - **Backend health check fix:** Aligned `BackendHealth` interface with Dashboard expectations (`ok`, `backendUrl`, `checkedAt`, `message` fields)
  - **Notebook preferences:** Added 'IES' to default notebook names for better domain-agnostic alignment
  - **Error handling enhancement:** `callBackendApi()` now properly throws errors instead of returning null, with detailed logging
  - **Purpose:** Completes merged architecture with full Package 07_System layer, fixes health check interface mismatch
- **ForgeMode Interactive Question-Response System (Phase 4 Remediation)** — Implements active cognitive guidance instead of passive question display:
  - `.worktrees/siyuan/ies/plugin/src/views/ForgeMode.svelte`: Complete interactive question-response workflow (1400+ lines)
  - **Question-response card:** `.question-response-card` component with class-specific colored borders, expandable hint section, textarea for user response
  - **Cognitive hints:** `QUESTION_CLASS_HINTS` provides class-specific guidance prompts (e.g., Schema-Probe: "Try listing the main categories, components, or buckets")
  - **Response starters:** Optional sentence starters to reduce friction (e.g., "The main parts are...", "This happens because...")
  - **Interactive flow:** User sees question → expands for hints → types response → submits → AI processes response → generates follow-up
  - **Session tracking:** Question-response exchanges captured in `questionResponseHistory` for transcript inclusion
  - **Impact:** Addresses critical finding "Questions displayed passively" — questions now drive active dialogue with cognitive scaffolding
  - **UI styling:** Complete CSS system (~440 lines) with `.qrc-header`, `.qrc-question`, `.qrc-hint`, `.qrc-input`, `.qrc-starter`/`.qrc-skip`/`.qrc-respond` buttons

- **Domain-Agnostic Notebook Configuration (SiYuan)** (commit 5e3ad8b) — Removed hardcoded therapy-specific notebook names:
  - `.worktrees/siyuan/ies/plugin/src/utils/siyuan-structure.ts`: Replaced `PREFERRED_NOTEBOOK_NAMES` with `DEFAULT_NOTEBOOK_NAMES` and `getPreferredNotebookNames()`
  - **User-configurable preferences:** Users can customize via localStorage `ies.preferredNotebooks` as JSON array
  - **Default names now domain-agnostic:** "Personal", "Knowledge", "Notes", "Intelligent Exploration System" (removed "Therapy", "Therapy Framework", "Framework Project")
  - **Backward compatible:** Falls back to defaults if localStorage is unavailable or parse fails
  - **Improved health checking:** Added `BackendHealth` interface, `cachedHealthStatus` variable, and `HEALTH_CACHE_TTL_MS` constant (30 seconds)
  - **Backend URL context comments:** Added clarification that SiYuan runs in Docker on 192.168.86.60, forwardProxy makes requests FROM container using host IP
  - **Question class tracking in sessions:** Added `questionClassesUsed?: string[]` field to `SessionDocumentOptions` interface
  - **Session document frontmatter:** Sessions now include `question_classes_used` array in YAML frontmatter when question classes are tracked
  - **Impact:** Plugin now works across any domain without therapy-specific assumptions, aligns with project goal of domain-agnostic architecture
- **IES AST Mode Documentation** (commit 3b347fc) — Comprehensive SiYuan notebook structure defining assisted structured thinking architecture:
  - `IES AST SiYuan structure.md`: Tracking document for 20 new SiYuan pages across 6 sections (Modes, Question Engine, Data Schemas, Specs, Templates, Workflows)
  - **Four thinking modes:** Discovery (schema surfacing), Dialogue (model building), Flow (associative exploration), AST (assisted structured thinking)
  - **Nine question classes:** Schema-Probe (hidden structure), Boundary (clarify edges), Dimensional (introduce spectra), Causal (mechanisms), Counterfactual (what-if), Anchor (concrete instances), Perspective-Shift (viewpoint change), Meta-Cognitive (thinking patterns), Reflective-Synthesis (integration)
  - **Mode Transition Engine:** Automatic mode switching based on interaction cadence, cognitive load markers, and resonance hits
  - **User Cognition Model integration:** 6-dimension profile drives template defaults and question class selection
  - **ADHD-friendly folder structure:** `/Daily/` (zero-friction capture), `/Insights/` (promoted sparks), `/Threads/` (exploration paths), `/Favorite Problems/` (anchor questions), `/Concepts/` (knowledge graph nodes)
  - **Data Schemas:** Seed Schema (atomic insights), Concept Schema (persistent ideas with causal structure), Block Attributes (SiYuan metadata standards), Note Templates (per-mode session templates)
  - **Integration:** AST mode bridges ForgeMode templates with Flow exploration, provides canonical placement for sparks/insights
  - **Documentation updates:** SYSTEM-DESIGN.md adds Section 3.7 (SiYuan AST Structure), PROJECT-OVERVIEW.md adds IES Question Engine preview, COMPREHENSIVE-PROJECT-STATUS.md updated with documentation status
  - **Source:** Based on IES Question Engine expansion spec synthesized with existing ADHD ontology design research

**Recent Changes (Dec 4):**
- **Entity Overlay UI Redesign** (commits 0b646cf, fddd8f0, 8887e90) — Enhanced user experience with pill-based controls and Flow Panel integration:
  - `.worktrees/readest/readest/apps/readest-app/src/app/reader/components/EntityTypeFilter.tsx`: Complete redesign from checkbox-based to pill-based UI (122 lines)
  - **Master toggle redesign:** Replaced checkbox with prominent ON/OFF button featuring eye icons (LuEye/LuEyeOff from react-icons)
  - **Pill controls:** Interactive type-specific pills replace traditional checkboxes for more intuitive visual feedback
  - **Active state styling:** Pills show type-specific colors with 12% opacity backgrounds when active, muted appearance when inactive
  - **Status indicator:** Centered display shows entity count ("X entities in this book"), loading spinner, error messages, or "Book not indexed" warning
  - **Disabled interaction:** Pills are properly disabled when overlay is off to prevent user confusion
  - **Flow Panel integration:** EntityTypeFilter positioned at top of Flow Panel (FlowPanel.tsx lines 156-159) for immediate access
  - **Flow Panel components updated:** EntitySection, RelationshipsSection, SourcesSection, QuestionsSection, Header all refined with type-specific badges and consistent styling
  - **CSS styling system:** Complete entity overlay styling in `globals.css` (lines 559-618 for filter controls, 756-855 for inline highlights)
  - **Type-specific colors:** Blue (Concept #2563eb), Green (Person #059669), Purple (Theory #7c3aed), Orange (Framework #ea580c), Red (Assessment #dc2626)
  - **Hover effects:** Underline decoration appears on hover with type-specific color transitions for both pills and inline highlights
  - **Visual consistency:** All Flow Panel sections now use consistent design language with flow-card, flow-section-header, relationship-badge classes
- **Template API for ForgeMode Integration** (commit 9fcc171) — New backend endpoint enables structured thinking sessions:
  - `ies/backend/src/ies_backend/api/template.py`: New FastAPI router with `GET /templates/{template_id}` endpoint (24 lines)
  - Returns `ThinkingTemplate` schema with sections, graph mapping rules, and AI behavior specifications
  - Registered in `ies/backend/src/ies_backend/main.py` with `/templates` prefix
  - Integration: `.worktrees/siyuan/ies/plugin/src/views/ForgeMode.svelte` fetches templates via SiYuan forwardProxy
  - Available templates: `learning-mechanism-map` (understand mechanisms), `articulating-clarify-intuition` (clarify vague thoughts)
  - Enables template-driven sessions with section-by-section progress tracking in ForgeMode UI
- **Auto Ingestion Daemon Operational** — Fixed critical Book-Entity relationship structure for full entity overlay compatibility:
  - `scripts/auto_ingest_daemon.py`: Fixed MENTIONS relationship creation between Book and Entity nodes (lines 150-156)
  - **Problem:** Auto-ingested books had entities but missing direct Book→MENTIONS→Entity relationships required by entity overlay feature
  - **Solution:** After entity extraction, daemon now creates MENTIONS relationships for each entity: `MATCH (b:Book {calibre_id: $calibre_id}) MATCH (e) WHERE e.name = $entity_name MERGE (b)-[:MENTIONS]->(e)`
  - **Impact:** Books processed by daemon now fully support entity overlay in Readest reading interface
  - **Results:** Successfully processed 9 out of 10 Calibre books with entity counts ranging from 6 to 169 entities per book
  - **Graph structure:** Now matches expected schema for `GET /graph/entities/by-calibre-id/{calibre_id}` endpoint
  - **Daemon status:** Background processing operational, running every 5 minutes with comprehensive entity extraction and proper Book-Entity linking
  - **Entity overlay requirement:** Books must be opened via Calibre Library dialog in Readest (not local library) to access indexed content
  - **SiYuan integration:** Suggestions API working and returns both connected entity suggestions and new entity recommendations
- **Tauri Runtime Detection Enhancement** — Fixed browser crashes with deep object validation (commit 7c9ca46):
  - `.worktrees/readest/readest/apps/readest-app/src/services/environment.ts`: Enhanced `isTauriAppPlatform()` with five-point validation
  - Problem: Setting `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_PLATFORM=tauri` alone caused app to attempt Tauri API calls in browser context, leading to crashes
  - Root cause: Partial `__TAURI_INTERNALS__` objects can exist in browser context without full Tauri functionality
  - Solution: Five-point validation ensures BOTH environment configuration AND complete Tauri runtime availability
  - Implementation checks:
    1. `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_PLATFORM === 'tauri'` — Environment configured for Tauri
    2. `typeof window !== 'undefined'` — Browser context exists (prevents SSR errors)
    3. `window.__TAURI_INTERNALS__ !== undefined` — Tauri object exists
    4. `typeof internals === 'object' && internals !== null` — Valid object structure
    5. `typeof internals.invoke === 'function'` — Critical: Full Tauri API available with invoke function
  - Rationale: Previous simple check (`'__TAURI_INTERNALS__' in window`) was insufficient because partial objects can exist without invoke capability
  - Safety: Each validation step builds on previous, preventing TypeError exceptions in edge cases
  - Impact: App gracefully falls back to WebAppService when running in browser, even if environment variable is incorrectly set
  - Use case: Enables running `pnpm dev` in browser for debugging without breaking Tauri-specific code paths
  - Pattern: `getNativeAppService()` catches Tauri plugin load failures and falls back to WebAppService
  - Related: `.worktrees/readest/readest/apps/readest-app/src/services/nativeAppService.ts` uses dynamic import for `@tauri-apps/plugin-os`
- **Readest Native Service Dynamic Import Fix** (commit 51b8ee3) — Fixed browser/Tauri context compatibility with dynamic plugin loading:
  - `.worktrees/readest/readest/apps/readest-app/src/services/nativeAppService.ts`: Removed static import of `@tauri-apps/plugin-os`, replaced with dynamic import
  - Problem: Static `import { type as osType } from '@tauri-apps/plugin-os'` executes module-level code requiring Tauri APIs, causing Next.js build failures in browser context
  - Solution: Dynamic import pattern with async initialization
  - Implementation: `initOsType()` async function calls `await import('@tauri-apps/plugin-os')` and caches result in `_osType` variable
  - Execution: `initOsType()` invoked at start of `NativeAppService.init()` method, which only runs in actual Tauri environment
  - Impact: All 20+ OS-type-dependent properties converted from static values to getters calling `getOsType()` (e.g., `override get isAndroidApp() { return getOsType() === 'android'; }`)
  - Pattern: Dynamic import ensures Tauri plugin only loads when running in Tauri, not during Next.js bundling for browser
  - Result: Eliminates module-level code execution that fails in browser/SSR contexts
- **Relationship Type Sanitization** — Enhanced Neo4j relationship creation with robust type validation:
  - `library/graph/neo4j_client.py`: `add_relationship()` method now sanitizes relationship types before creating Neo4j relationships
  - Replaces spaces and hyphens with underscores (e.g., "RELATED TO" → "RELATED_TO")
  - Removes invalid characters using regex (only A-Z, 0-9, underscore allowed in Neo4j relationship types)
  - Fallback to "RELATED_TO" for empty/invalid types
  - Prevents Neo4j Cypher syntax errors during ingestion from malformed relationship type names
- **GraphService Entity Query Fix** (Dec 4) — Critical alignment between ingestion and query patterns:
  - **Problem:** Entity overlay failing because queries used old Book<-Chunk->Entity pattern while ingestion creates direct Book->Entity relationships
  - **Solution:** Modified `get_entities_by_calibre_id()` and `get_entities_by_book()` to use `MATCH (b)-[:MENTIONS]->(e)` pattern
  - **Root cause:** `scripts/ingest_calibre.py` creates direct Book-MENTIONS->Entity relationships without intermediate Chunk nodes
  - **Impact:** Entity overlay now works correctly by matching actual graph structure created during book ingestion
  - **Pattern change:** From `MATCH (b)<-[:BELONGS_TO]-(chunk)-[:MENTIONS]->(e)` to `MATCH (b)-[:MENTIONS]->(e)`
  - **Files changed:** `ies/backend/src/ies_backend/services/graph_service.py` lines 218 and 267
- **Calibre Integration Phase 3 Complete (Commit 3c2efde)** — Multi-pass ingestion pipeline for Calibre books into Neo4j:
  - Ingestion script: `scripts/ingest_calibre.py` — Extracts entities from Calibre books and stores in Neo4j with `calibre_id` as primary identifier (263 lines)
  - Multi-pass pipeline: Pass 1 (structure: Book node + chunks + entities + MENTIONS relationships → status: entities_extracted)
  - Future passes: Pass 2 (relationships), Pass 3 (LLM enrichment with reframes, mechanisms, patterns)
  - Migration script: `scripts/match_calibre_ids.py` — Matches existing Neo4j Book nodes to Calibre books by title/author similarity for one-time migration (167 lines)
  - KnowledgeGraph updates: `add_book()` accepts `calibre_id` parameter, `book_exists()` checks by calibre_id, `update_book_status()` tracks processing lifecycle
  - Entity extraction: Uses existing `EntityExtractor` from `library/graph/entities.py` with OpenAI
  - Status lifecycle: `pending → chunked → entities_extracted → relationships_mapped → enriched`
  - CLI features: `--id` (single book), `--test` (one book test), `--status` (processing stats), `--limit` (batch size)
  - Library path: `/home/chris/Documents/calibre` (179 books)
- **Calibre Integration Phase 2 Complete (Commit 9542ec2, updated 6d607af)** — Backend APIs for Calibre book library access:
  - New `CalibreService` queries Calibre `metadata.db` SQLite database with `get_book_file_path()` method (128 lines)
  - New `Book` schema with `calibre_id`, `title`, `author`, `path` (Pydantic model)
  - Books API: `GET /books`, `GET /books?search=`, `GET /books/{calibre_id}`, `GET /books/{calibre_id}/cover` (125 lines)
  - **File serving endpoints:** `HEAD /books/{calibre_id}/file` (metadata only), `GET /books/{calibre_id}/file` (epub/pdf download)
  - File serving: Prefers epub over pdf, serves with correct media types (application/epub+zip or application/pdf)
  - GraphService: New `get_entities_by_calibre_id()` method for direct Calibre ID entity lookup (47 lines)
  - Entity API: New `GET /graph/entities/by-calibre-id/{calibre_id}` endpoint (20 lines)
  - Tests: 85/85 backend tests passing (6 CalibreService tests, 6 Books API tests, 3 entity endpoint tests)
  - Eliminates hash/title matching fragility by using Calibre as single source of truth
- **Backend Refactoring** (commit a9ce87b) — Enhanced session processing and state detection:
  - New `SessionService` extracted from `session.py` for cleaner separation of concerns (142 lines)
  - Orchestrates session extraction, storage, and template mapping pipeline
  - Enhanced `StateDetectionService` with improved word boundary matching for marker detection
  - Added context handling for repetition detection and emotional state analysis
  - Book entities API: Added `title` query parameter for dual identifier strategy (hash OR title matching)
  - ADHD ontology exports: Added `Reframe` and `ReframeType` to `library/graph/__init__.py`
  - Schema updates: Additional entity fields for session processing
  - Tests: 70/70 backend tests passing (all question_engine tests fixed)
- **Entity Overlay Feature Complete** (commit 3a513b2) — Real-time entity highlighting in Readest reading interface:
  - Backend: GET `/graph/entities/by-book/{book_hash}` endpoint returns entities sorted by mention frequency
  - GraphService: `get_entities_by_book()` method with entity type filtering support
  - Frontend: Entity overlay transformer wraps entity mentions in styled spans for inline highlighting
  - UI: EntityTypeFilter component with master toggle and per-type visibility controls (Concept, Person, Theory, Framework, Assessment)
  - State: flowModeStore manages overlay state, entity fetching, and type filtering
  - Integration: FoliateViewer auto-fetches entities on book load, transforms HTML content with entity highlights
  - Tests: 70/70 backend tests passing (3 new tests for book_entities endpoint)
- **Phase 2c Backend Complete** (commit 46bc30b) — Three integrated backend services addressing critical gaps #1 and #2:
  - Reframe API (`/reframes`) — Concept reframes via Claude Sonnet 4 with caching and feedback voting
  - Personal Graph API (`/personal`) — ADHD-friendly spark/insight capture with resonance and energy-based retrieval
  - Template Service — JSON-based thinking templates with validation and graph mapping execution
- Updated `library/graph/__init__.py` to export unified graph API with ADHD-friendly ontology implementation for personal knowledge capture.
