# Example: Seedlings

Below are some illustrative `seed-block`s.

## S1 – ADHD as time blindness

```yaml
block_type: seed
idea_type: insight
domain: ADHD
source: inbox
clarity: clear
confidence: high
created_at: 2025-12-05T10:00:00-05:00
last_touched_at: 2025-12-05T10:00:00-05:00
related_concepts: [adhd_time, executive_function]
tags: [time, adhd, lived_experience]
```

> ADHD isn't just about attention; it often feels like living without a stable sense of time.
> The future doesn’t feel *real* until it’s right on top of me.

## S2 – Curiosity-driven entry point

```yaml
block_type: seed
idea_type: question
domain: Self
source: inbox
clarity: partial
confidence: medium
created_at: 2025-12-05T10:05:00-05:00
last_touched_at: 2025-12-05T10:05:00-05:00
related_concepts: [entry_points, motivation]
tags: [curiosity, starting, paralysis]
```

> What if my brain can’t “start from zero” because it needs *curiosity hooks* instead of blank choice?

## S3 – Therapy as translation

```yaml
block_type: seed
idea_type: metaphor
domain: Therapy
source: dialogue
clarity: clear
confidence: high
created_at: 2025-12-05T10:10:00-05:00
last_touched_at: 2025-12-05T10:10:00-05:00
related_concepts: [neurodivergent_translation, therapy_role]
tags: [metaphor, communication]
```

> Being a therapist for neurodivergent clients often feels like being a translator between internal experience and a world that never learned their language.
