# Example: Dialogue Session – Entry Point Paralysis

```yaml
session_id: dialogue-2025-12-05-entry-points
mode: dialogue
focus:
  - seed:S2
created_at: 2025-12-05T10:15:00-05:00
last_touched_at: 2025-12-05T10:45:00-05:00
```

## 1. Context

We’re exploring why “starting from zero” feels impossible and how to design systems
that always provide an entry point instead of a blank page.

Seedlings involved:
- S2 – Curiosity-driven entry point

---

## 2. Exploration Phase

**AI:** When you say you “can’t start from zero,” what does that feel like in your body and thoughts?

**Chris:** It feels like standing in a huge empty warehouse. There are technically infinite options,
but none of them are *real* enough to move toward.

**AI (reflection):** So it’s not lack of ideas, it’s lack of *grabbable* ideas—nothing has a handle.

**Chris:** Exactly. If you hand me *anything* concrete—a question, a constraint, a piece of
existing structure—I can move immediately.

---

## 3. Challenge / Reframe

**AI:** Is it fair to say your brain wants:
- a starting *object*, not a starting *space*?
- a prompt that implies a direction, not pure freedom?

**Chris:** Yes. “Here are three possible paths, pick one” works. “What do you want to do?” does not.

**AI:** Then maybe we should treat “entry points” as an actual *infrastructure*, not an afterthought.

---

## 4. Synthesis

Key insight:

> Your systems should never present you with “blank space.” They should present **pre-curated entry points**:
> daily landing pages, active project maps, questions in motion.

New Seedlings:

- S4 – “Entry points as infrastructure, not decoration”
- S5 – “Curated options vs. blank choice”

---

## 5. Next Steps

- Create a Flow Map for “Entry Points Architecture”.
- Update concept pages for:
  - `entry_points`
  - `motivation`
- Embed “Entry Point Summary” sections into:
  - Dialogue templates
  - Project pages
  - Daily landing pages
