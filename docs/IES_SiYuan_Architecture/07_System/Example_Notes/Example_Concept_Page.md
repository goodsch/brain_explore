## 1. Working Definition

Entry points are **structured ways of starting** that give my brain something
to grab onto, instead of asking it to create direction from a blank state.

They are the opposite of “What do you want to do?” and more like
“Here are three paths already laid out—pick one.”

## 2. Core Dimensions

- **Surface:** where the entry shows up (daily page, project map, etc.).
- **Granularity:** tiny (one question) vs. big (project view).
- **Commitment level:** light peek vs. heavy “let’s go.”
- **Emotional load:** safe and curious vs. high-stakes.

## 3. How This Shows Up

- In my life:
  - I move easily when given a concrete handle.
  - I freeze when asked to generate direction from nothing.

- In systems I design:
  - I often build powerful tools but forget the **entry experience**.

## 4. Related Concepts

- Closely related:
  - Motivation
  - ADHD time perception
  - Executive function
  - Choice paralysis

- Often confused with:
  - “Just pick something”
  - Raw to-do lists

## 5. Examples & Vignettes

- A daily landing page that says:
  - “Here are 3 projects that would matter today, and the easiest next step for each.”

- A concept explorer that says:
  - “You’ve been thinking a lot about ADHD + time—want to see that cluster?”

## 6. Common Pitfalls

- Making entry points too heavy or demanding.
- Providing too many options at once.
- Forgetting to update them as my context changes.
