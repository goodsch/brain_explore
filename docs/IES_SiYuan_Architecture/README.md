# IES × SiYuan Architecture Package

Generated: 2025-12-05

This package contains a fully opinionated, AI-friendly SiYuan-style structure in Markdown.
You can use an AI assistant (via MCP or similar) to:

- Mirror this folder structure into SiYuan notebooks
- Turn templates into actual SiYuan templates/snippets
- Map block schemas to attributes/custom properties
- Wire your IES modes (Capture → Dialogue → Flow → Synthesis → Archive) to concrete locations

## Contents

- `00_Inbox/` — Ephemeral capture and raw input
- `01_Seedlings/` — Atomic ideas, observations, questions
- `02_Shaping/` — Dialogue-mode guided questioning and mini-syntheses
- `03_Flow_Maps/` — Graph-like exploration and maps
- `04_Concepts/` — Canonical concept pages (your knowledge graph)
- `05_Projects/` — Project structures, plans, decisions, logs
- `06_Archive/` — Retired / superseded material
- `07_System/` — Templates, schemas, directives, and diagrams

The system assumes **notes are primarily created and edited by an AI assistant** following the rules in:

- `07_System/AI_Assistant_Directives.md`
- `07_System/Block_Schemas.md`
- `07_System/IES_SiYuan_Dataflow.md`
- `07_System/System_Architecture_Diagram.md`

Start by reading the directives, then have your AI assistant:

1. Clone this structure into SiYuan.
2. Implement block types using attributes.
3. Register templates in SiYuan for quick insertion.
4. Use the example notes as references for style and behavior.
