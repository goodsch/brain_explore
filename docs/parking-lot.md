# Future Project Parking Lot

**Rule:** Nothing on this list enters active development until Phase 1 is complete with measurable therapeutic value.

*Last Updated: Dec 2, 2025*

## Future Features (Defer Until Phase 2+)

### High Priority (If Phase 1 proves concept)
- **Flow Mode Reading Interface** (40-60 hours)
  - Non-linear reading of PDFs with graph navigation
  - Interactive knowledge exploration
  - AI documentation of reading path
  - Defer until: After 30 therapy concepts developed

- **Advanced Questioning Modes** (20-30 hours)
  - 8 inquiry approaches (Socratic, Metacognitive, Phenomenological, CBT, Solution-focused, Systems, Narrative, Strategic)
  - Adapt questioning to user profile
  - Defer until: After therapy exploration workflow proven

### Medium Priority
- **Plugin Model Selection Implementation** (4-6 hours)
  - Settings panel has model dropdowns but they're decorative
  - Backend uses hardcoded models (claude-3-5-sonnet, claude-sonnet-4)
  - Need: Backend accepts model param, plugin passes settings.chatModel
  - Defer until: Core features stable, model flexibility actually needed

- **MCP Server Integration** (15-20 hours)
  - Expose IES backend as MCP server
  - Enable Claude app voice interaction
  - Defer until: After stable IES plugin exists

- **n8n Integration** (12-15 hours)
  - Create workflow automation nodes
  - Turn IES into n8n-compatible server
  - Defer until: After API endpoints proven stable

### Low Priority (Post-Generalization)
- **Advanced Visualization** (50+ hours)
  - Knowledge graph visualization
  - Exploration pattern analytics
  - Defer until: After 50+ therapy sessions exist

- **Multi-Domain Framework** (60+ hours)
  - Generic configuration system
  - Domain-specific implementations
  - Defer until: Second real use case exists

## Future Projects (Defer Until Proven)

### Synapse Generalization (Post-Phase 4)
- Port 5 salvageable Synapse components (~17 hours)
- Build generic meta-cognitive exploration framework
- Create implementation instances for multiple domains
- Defer until: Therapy use case proven, generalization requirements clear

### Research Integration (Ongoing)
- Integrate therapy research papers and studies
- Create therapy research knowledge graph
- Document theoretical foundations
- Defer until: Basic concept framework complete

### Institutional Features (Post-Phase 5)
- Multi-user support
- Therapist-client pairing
- Session management
- Institutional deployment patterns
- Defer until: Personal use proven, demand exists

## Why Defer?

Each item on this list:
1. Seems useful while building current system
2. Would add 50-200 hours of complexity
3. Would delay proving core hypothesis
4. Would create new meta-work
5. Would repeat Synapse's abandonment trajectory

**The discipline:** Build them in the right order, not the order they're thought of.

## Success Criteria for Moving Items to Active Work

Before any item leaves this parking lot:

1. Phase 1 must be complete (core IES proven valuable)
2. Clear user demand (not imagined need)
3. Explicit design document (not just idea)
4. Time estimate with confidence (not guesswork)
5. Clear success criteria (not vague aspirations)

## Review Schedule

- Check this list monthly
- Before starting any new work, verify it's not on this list
- Move items to active work only when success criteria met
