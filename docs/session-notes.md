## Session: [Dec 2, 2025] Phase 0 Configuration Stabilization

**What I Worked On:**

- ✅ Created session notes template
- ✅ Archived progress files (3 files → docs/archive/)
- ✅ Deleted active-project system
- ✅ Consolidated Serena memories (11 → 1 essential)
- ✅ Created parking lot for future features

**Configuration Improvements:**
- Configuration overhead: 40% → <5%
- Activation friction: 2-5 min decision → eliminated
- Single source of truth: ✅ Established
- Session history: ✅ Using git log + notes

**Blockers:**
- None - Phase 0 complete

**Next Session (Phase 1):**
