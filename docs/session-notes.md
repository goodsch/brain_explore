## Session: [Dec 2, 2025] Phase 0 Execution

**What I Worked On:**
- Initialized git repository
- Consolidated CLAUDE.md files (4 files → 1)
- Archived old progress files
- Consolidated Serena memories (11 → 4)
- Deleted active-project system
- Configuration overhead: 40% → <5%

**What I Learned:**
- Configuration system was creating 40% session overhead
- Activation friction came from multiple config layers
- Single source of truth dramatically simplifies workflow

**Blockers:**
- None - Phase 0 complete

**Next Session Should:**
- Begin Phase 1: Prove core IES works for therapy exploration
- Build minimum viable SiYuan plugin interface
- Create user profile and run first exploration session
