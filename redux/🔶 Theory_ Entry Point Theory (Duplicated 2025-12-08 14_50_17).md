# 🔶 Theory: Entry Point Theory (Duplicated 2025-12-08 14:50:17)

(block_id: ENTRY_POINT_THEORY)

---

## 1. Summary

Entry Point Theory states that meaningful thinking cannot begin from a blank state.  
It requires a **contextual hook** — an "entry point" — for cognition to activate.

This is a neurological and phenomenological characteristic of ADHD and nonlinear thinkers.

Thinking begins only when there is *something to grab onto*.

## 3. Core Principles

### 1. No Thought Begins From Zero

Blank states create paralysis, not creativity.

### 2. Context Reduces Activation Energy

The right stimulus begins thinking “for you.”

### 3. Not All Entry Points Are Equal

Some ignite insight; others create friction.

### 4. Entry Points Are Personal

They depend on internal interest, schema, and emotional state.

### 5. Entry Points Structure the Path of Exploration

Where you begin determines where you end.

---

## 4. Explanation

ADHD and nonlinear thinkers require a “starter node” before cognition can unfold.  
The brain does not spontaneously generate structured thought — it navigates *relationships*.

Without an entry point:

- there is no direction
- no meaning
- no motion
- no relevance
- no traction

Entry points overcome the **activation energy barrier**, allowing movement → which allows insight.

## 5. Examples

- You cannot “start writing,” but you can respond to a prompt.
- You cannot “brainstorm a project,” but a single idea triggers a cascade.
- You cannot “choose a concept to explore,” but you can explore something that caught your attention.

## 10. Open Questions

- What distinguishes a weak entry point from a strong one?
- Can emotional entry points differ from conceptual ones?
- Can AI generate personalized, optimal entry points dynamically?

---

## 11. Implications

### Cognitive

Entry points determine the *path* of thought.

### Behavioral

Use prompts, distinctions, and contrasts to begin action.

### Systemic

Flow Mode should always offer several entry nodes.
