# 🧩 Feynman Problem: Why Can’t I Start From Zero?

(block_id: PROBLEM_START_ZERO)

---

## 1. Summary

I consistently struggle to begin tasks, thinking sessions, reading, writing, and decision-making **when there is no contextual anchor**.  
Blank states freeze me.  
Even simple actions become impossible unless there is a *starting point* already present.

Why?

This problem investigates the **mechanisms of initiation**, the **cognitive architecture of ADHD**, and the **role of context, attention, and activation energy** in forming thought.

---

## 2. Why This Matters

This is a *central uncertainty* in my life.

Understanding it would clarify:

- executive function struggles
- ADHD paralysis
- difficulty starting conversations or tasks
- why I rely so heavily on AI dialogue
- why Flow Mode excels and blank screens fail
- why movement and entry points matter so deeply
- how to design systems that “start me up” without friction

It is a question that spans:

- cognition
- neuroscience
- psychology
- behavior
- identity

It is a **keystone problem**.

## 3. Current Best Understanding

The leading hypothesis:

> **I cannot start from zero because my cognition requires an “entry point” — a contextual anchor that reduces activation energy and triggers movement, which is the generator of meaning.**

Mechanisms likely involved:

1. **ADHD-related activation energy barrier**
2. **Context-dependent cognition**
3. **Absence of internal cues → need for external triggers**
4. **Nonlinear neural pathways needing initial momentum**
5. **Movement-required meaning-making (Movement Creates Meaning)**
6. **Working memory instability**
7. **Attentional selection machinery needing a "target"**

This problem is at the intersection of **Entry Point Theory** and **Movement Creates Meaning**.

## 8. Hypotheses

### Hypothesis A — Entry Point Deficit

Without a concrete anchor, attention cannot “lock on.”

### Hypothesis B — Activation Energy Barrier

The brain requires more dopamine than baseline to start movement.

### Hypothesis C — Cognitive Inertia

Nonlinear thinkers need *momentum*, not stillness.

### Hypothesis D — Unbounded Choice Paralysis

“Zero” represents infinite, unbounded possibility → too many degrees of freedom.

### Hypothesis E — Working Memory Fragility

You cannot hold goals, steps, or context long enough to initiate action.

---

## 9. Predictions

- If given a contextual hook → starting becomes easy
- If Flow Mode provides a starting node → movement begins
- If Dialogue Mode prompts you → paralysis disappears
- If the starting surface is concrete (not abstract) → initiation is instant
- If you generate your own entry point → action unlocks

These predictions can be tested via:

- behavioral experiments
- journaling sessions
- Flow vs. blank tests
- AI-assisted start protocols

---

## 10. Open Questions

- What is the difference between a *weak* and *strong* entry point?
- How much structure is enough to start without overwhelming?
- Can external tools (AI, prompts, Flow Mode) permanently reduce initiation friction?
- Does emotional context function as an entry point?
- Can entry points be artificially generated?
- Do internal “micro-starts” exist inside larger tasks?

---

## 11. Implications

### Cognitive

Your mind is incapable of unanchored initiation — it needs relational context.

### Behavioral

Always begin with something — never from zero.

### Systemic

Flow Mode must **never show a blank screen**.  
Dialogue Mode must **generate entry points automatically**.  
Capture Mode must **produce immediate handholds for beginning exploration**.

### Emotional

Difficulty starting is not failure — it is architecture.
