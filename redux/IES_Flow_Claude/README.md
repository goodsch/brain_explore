# IES / Flow Mode – Question-First Knowledge System

This directory contains a structured specification of the question-first,
Feynman-problem-driven knowledge system, including:

- Core entities (Feynman Problems, Projects, Questions, Concepts)
- Question Graph and Knowledge Graph design
- Flow Mode user interaction model
- Multi-layer entity and source processing pipeline
- Example centered on ADHD Time Perception
- JSON-like schemas for use in downstream tools

It is organized for easy analysis by an LLM (e.g., Claude or other tools).
You can point your model at this whole directory as a "project" and ask it
to generate code, data models, or UI designs based on the spec.
