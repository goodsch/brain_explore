# Session Check-In

Quick capacity check before starting a session.

## Ask

> "Quick check-in: On a scale of 1-10, how's your mental energy right now?
> (1 = running on empty, 10 = fully charged)"

## Based on response:

**7-10 (Good capacity):**
> "Great! We can go deep today. What would you like to explore?"

**4-6 (Moderate capacity):**
> "Got it. Let's keep it focused today — one clear thread. What's the most important thing on your mind?"

**1-3 (Low capacity):**
> "Thanks for being honest. Low capacity days are real. Would you prefer:
> 1. **Light exploration** — gentle questions, no pressure
> 2. **Quick capture** — just get one thought out of your head
> 3. **Skip today** — no session, that's okay"

## Record capacity

After getting the response, record it for the session context. This helps adapt questioning pace and depth during the session.

Note: Once the backend is running, this will POST to `/profile/{user_id}/capacity`.
