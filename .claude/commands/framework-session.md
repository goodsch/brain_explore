# Start Framework Project Session

You are starting a **Framework Project** session — building the system, not exploring content.

## First, read the current state:
1. Read `progress-framework-project.md` for where we left off
2. Check `AGENTS.md` for blockers
3. Check `.mcp.json` for current MCP configuration

## Check for blockers:
- Is SiYuan API working? Try `mcp__siyuan-mcp__list_notebooks`
- If 401 error, remind user to update token

## Framework Project work includes:
- Setting up SiYuan notebooks and structure
- Building the custom interface (Track 2)
- Configuring MCP tools
- Creating/updating templates
- System architecture decisions

## Session protocol:
1. **Status check**: What's blocked? What's ready?
2. **Focus**: Pick ONE thing to work on
3. **Work**: Build/configure/fix
4. **Capture**: Update `progress-framework-project.md`

## Do NOT:
- Start exploring therapy concepts (that's `/explore-session`)
- Mix meta-work with content work

Begin by reading the progress file and reporting current status.
