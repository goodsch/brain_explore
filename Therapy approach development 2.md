Here is a brain dump for you to parse: For awhile I have been wanting to take the time to think about and actually map out my approach to therapy for many reasons. I want to first and foremost actually understand myself and how I conceptualize therapy and the human experience. I want to be able to determine why and how I do what I do so that I can market better and hopefully begin to create my own approach. I don’t believe that the few popular theories and approaches are the end all be all and I hate just regurgitating what others have done before because I think we can do better and shouldn’t just leave well enough alone. I want to develop a holistic framework of why humans are the way they are. I want to have a more systematic approach to therapy that aligns with what would have worked for me. I want people to understand themselves and to be able to be understood. I have difficult time organizing thoughts and want a way to think about all of this in a structured way that works with my brain. I want you to help me create an approach to starting this journey

---

Let’s slow this down and shape it into something you can walk through with clarity rather than overwhelm. You’re trying to articulate the *roots* of your therapeutic worldview, not just build a marketable model. That’s a big, layered project. Before diving into structure, it might help to tease apart a few threads that seem intertwined in your brain dump.

Here’s a first pass, just reflecting back the pieces I see—then I’ll ask you a few targeted questions to help you clarify the starting point.

---

## What you’re actually trying to do (as I hear it)

### 1\. Understand your own internal map

- How you see humans.
- How you make sense of suffering, change, meaning, development.
- Why you intervene the way you do.
- What sits underneath your clinical instincts.

### 2\. Build a coherent, system-level therapy framework

- Something that *could* become a modality or approach.
- Holistic: biology, emotion, cognition, trauma, relationships, environment.
- Not a rehash of CBT/psychodynamic/IFS/etc.
- Something that aligns with the way *your* mind works.

### 3\. Make that framework usable in your actual practice

- A way to organize sessions.
- A way to conceptualize clients consistently.
- Something you could explain to clients or other clinicians.

### 4\. Use that clarity to communicate your work outwardly

- For marketing.
- For finding your niche.
- For eventually teaching or building resources.

### 5\. Create a process that works with your ADHD brain

- Structured.
- Visual.
- Layered rather than linear.
- Not dependent on holding all the pieces in your head at once.

---

## Before we build anything, you need one anchor question:

**Are you trying to develop a model of *the human mind*, or a model of *the therapeutic process*?**

Those overlap, but they aren’t the same.  
Your dump touches both:

- “Why humans are the way they are” → a theory of mind
- “How I conceptualize therapy” → a clinical model
- “A more systematic approach that would have worked for me” → a process model
- “Help people understand themselves and be understood” → a framework for meaning-making

If we don’t separate these early, everything blends into a giant conceptual soup.

So let me ask you a few clarifying, grounding questions. These aren’t about jumping to solutions—they’re about getting the real shape of what you want.

---

## Clarifying Questions (choose whichever feels most concrete to answer first)

### 1\. When you imagine your “holistic framework,” what problem is it trying to solve?

Not in abstract terms—what felt problem keeps showing up in your work that makes you think:  
*"There has to be a better way to explain this or work with this."*

### 2\. What’s missing from existing therapy models that leaves you dissatisfied?

Is it:

- How they explain *why* people are the way they are?
- How they explain *change*?
- Their rigidity?
- Their lack of nuance?
- Their focus on symptoms?
- Something else?

### 3\. When you’re at your best with a client, what are you actually doing?

Not the technique—what *process* is happening?

### 4\. If you picture a diagram of your therapeutic worldview, what “pieces” do you already know belong on it?

For example:

- biology
- neurodivergence
- attachment
- identity
- emotion processing
- narrative
- environment
- values
- trauma
- etc.

Even a messy list helps.

### 5\. What would make this process feel manageable rather than overwhelming?

A map?  
A set of prompts?  
A step-by-step research plan?  
A visual model to fill in?  
Something conversational?

---

If you answer even one or two of these, I can help you build a structured approach that works with—rather than against—your brain.

Where would you like to start?

---

In response to the anchor question, yes. I am trying to do multiple things and we should start by splitting it up

---

Great — that gives us a clear place to begin. Let’s separate the project into **three distinct tracks**, each with its own purpose and process. Once they’re separated, we can look at how they relate without letting them collapse into each other.

I’ll keep this tight and structured so you can see the shape clearly.

---

## THE THREE TRACKS

## Track 1 — Your Theory of the Human Mind

This is your “why humans are the way they are” track.

Think:  
the forces that shape people → how they develop → how they get stuck → how they heal → what produces meaning → what produces suffering → how neurodivergence changes the whole equation.

This = your **foundational worldview**.

### What goes here:

- How you understand human nature
- What drives behavior and emotion
- Development (typical and neurodivergent)
- Internal conflicts
- Trauma and adaptation
- Values and identity
- Needs and motivation
- Systems and environment
- Your personal lived-experience lens

This track becomes the backbone of your future “model.”

---

## Track 2 — Your Theory of Change / Therapy Process

This is:  
**Given your theory of the mind, how does therapy actually create change?**

This includes:

- How you assess people
- How you conceptualize their problems
- What you believe actually moves the needle
- The sequence of change
- The therapist–client relationship
- Skills you build
- What the client learns about themselves
- Where insight fits, where behavior fits, where emotion fits

This becomes the **clinical framework** you use session-to-session.

---

## Track 3 — Your Practical System / Structure for Doing Therapy

This is the ADHD-friendly, real-world operational layer.

This answers:

- How do you organize your work?
- How do you conceptualize clients consistently?
- How do you track progress?
- How do you ensure your model is usable?
- How do you teach it?
- How do you market it?
- How do you talk about it clearly?

This becomes the **method**, the toolbox, the templates, the “this is how I work” component.

---

## How These Tracks Depend on Each Other

- Track 1 (human nature) gives you the philosophical / psychological foundation.
- Track 2 (change process) gives you the therapeutic engine.
- Track 3 (system) gives you the day-to-day translation.

Trying to do all three at once is what was creating the mental tangle.

Now we can break the project down cleanly.

---

## NEXT STEP

Pick which track you want to start defining first.

To help you choose, here are three guiding questions:

### If you want clarity about your identity as a therapist → start with Track 1.

### If you want clarity about your actual method in the room → start with Track 2.

### If you want clarity about organization, templates, and workflow → start with Track 3.

Which feels like the most useful starting point for you right now?

---

Let’s use notion to do this

---

Alright — before we build anything inside Notion, I want to pin down what *kind* of structure your brain works best in. If we skip that step, you’ll end up with another workspace that becomes chaotic instead of supportive.

Let me offer a simple, minimal scaffolding for all three tracks, and then I’ll ask a couple targeted questions so we know exactly how to shape the Notion build.

---

## A Clean Notion Structure for Your Therapy Framework

Think of it as three “workbenches” rather than one giant page.

---

## 📘 Track 1 — Theory of the Human Mind

**Database:** “Human Framework Library”  
**View Types:**

- Kanban (domains of human functioning)
- Outlines
- Linked maps between ideas

**Properties (fields):**

- Domain (e.g., Identity, Emotion, Neurodivergence, Development, Systems)
- Summary
- Mechanisms (the “how it works”)
- Clinical implications
- Notes from your own life experience
- Research references
- Connections to other concepts

This lets you gradually build your worldview *in small pieces*, not essays.

---

## 🔧 Track 2 — Theory of Change / Therapy Process

**Database:** “Change Process Model”  
**Views:**

- Stage-based flow
- Decision tree
- Session applications

**Properties:**

- Stage (e.g., Awareness → Regulation → Insight → Integration → Action)
- What the therapist does
- What the client does
- What changes internally here
- Example interventions
- Missteps to avoid
- Outcome of this stage
- Link to Track 1 concepts used here

This becomes your session compass.

---

## 🗂️ Track 3 — Practical System / Therapist Toolkit

**Database:** “Therapy Method System”  
**Sections (pages):**

- Session structure
- Intake structure
- Treatment planning templates
- Conceptualization templates
- Marketing/communication language
- Worksheets or client metaphors/tools
- A glossary of terms from your model

This is the operational layer — the part that makes your approach teachable and useable.

---

## Now, to customize this for your brain, I need to ask you two things:

## 1\. What format helps you think most clearly inside Notion?

Examples:

- Kanban boards
- Outlines
- Tables with linked items
- Nested pages with toggles
- Visual diagrams (Embedded Excalidraw, Whiteboards, etc.)
- A master dashboard you click into

Which of those feels supportive vs overwhelming?

---

## 2\. How do you want the pieces to connect?

Two common patterns:

### A. “One central hub”

Everything funnels into one dashboard with clear entry points.

### B. “Modular islands”

Each part (mind, change process, tools) lives separately, and you link them only when needed.

Both are valid — your ADHD brain will usually prefer one.

---

When you tell me:

- your preferred working format
- whether you want one hub or modular sections

…I’ll draft your exact Notion structure with the pages, database fields, template buttons, and a starter layout you can copy/paste directly.

Where do you lean?

---

I don’t know

---

Let’s narrow it down by anchoring in *how your mind works when you're actually trying to think about something complex.*

Instead of asking you to choose a Notion format directly, let me ask three concrete questions about your thinking style. Your answers will point us straight to the right structure.

Answer each with whatever comes to mind first — no need to overthink.

---

## 1\. When you’re trying to understand something complicated…

Which feels more natural?

A) Seeing all the main pieces at a glance  
B) Starting with one piece and only opening more as needed  
C) Moving pieces around visually until the structure “clicks”  
D) Writing in freeform notes and sorting later

---

## 2\. When you return to a project after a few days…

Which situation would help you better?

A) A single “start here” page that tells you where everything lives  
B) A simple list of the next three things you were working on  
C) A visual map showing where you left off  
D) Search + tags so you can jump directly to any part

---

## 3\. When ideas pop up while you’re working…

You tend to:

A) Want a quick place to dump them and sort later  
B) Prefer adding them directly to the right spot with a few clicks  
C) Forget them unless there’s a clear capture box right in front of you  
D) Want both a capture spot *and* a way to immediately link ideas together

---

Choose A/B/C/D for each.  
Once you answer, I can give you the exact Notion layout that matches how your mind naturally organizes information.

---

1\. Honestly I don’t know 2. Probably C 3. A C and D

---

Thanks — that gives us enough signal to work with, even if some of it feels fuzzy on your end.

Here’s what your answers point toward:

- You **don’t reliably know upfront** how you want to think about a problem → you need a workspace that can flex as you go.
- You orient best when you can **see the shape of where you left off** (visual map).
- Your idea-capture needs to be **instant**, **always available**, and **sortable later**, *but* also able to link ideas together when you’re ready.

This combination strongly suggests a **hybrid structure**:

- **A visual dashboard** that orients you each time you come back (your “map”).
- **Three separate workspaces** (one per track) so the complexity doesn’t collapse together.
- **A universal quick-capture inbox** that you can access from anywhere in Notion.
- **Light linking**, not heavy upfront categorization.

You don’t need to choose a “format.” We can build something that supports your uncertainty instead of demanding you pick a style.

Let me lay out the structure that would fit your pattern.

---

## ⭐ Your Notion Setup (Tailored to Your Thinking Style)

## MAIN PAGE: “Therapy Framework Hub”

This is your single landing page with a **visual map** (simple diagram or linked database gallery).  
It includes:

### 1\. Big Visual Map (centerpiece)

A simple three-node layout:

- **Human Mind Theory**
- **Change Process**
- **Therapy Method System**

Each node links to its own workspace.  
This gives you the “C” you said helps you reorient.

---

## SECTION: Universal Quick Capture

This sits at the top of the hub and on every workspace page.

**Database:** “Ideas & Fragments”  
It has:

- Title
- Freeform note
- Tags (optional)
- “Send to Track” (select: Mind / Change / Method)

This meets your A → dump quickly  
and C/D → later connect & sort.

You never lose thoughts because capture is always visible and frictionless.

---

## 🌱 WORKSPACE 1 — Human Mind Theory

Goal: explore how you see people, development, neurodivergence, trauma, identity, etc.

Structure:

- **Database** called “Human Concepts”
- View 1: *List view* for focused writing
- View 2: *Board by domain* (Identity, Emotion, Systems, Neurodivergence, Values, etc.)
- View 3: *Visual map* using Notion whiteboard (macroscale connections)

You can start with tiny fragments and grow them into full concepts.

---

## 🔄 WORKSPACE 2 — Change Process Model

Goal: clarify how therapy works from your perspective.

Structure:

- **Database** called “Mechanisms of Change”
- View 1: *Stage-based board* (Awareness → Emotional Safety → Insight → Integration → Action → Maintenance)
- View 2: *Decision-tree style outline*
- View 3: *“Client journey” timeline*

This keeps your method from becoming a loose cloud of ideas.

---

## 🧰 WORKSPACE 3 — Therapist Method System

Goal: operationalize your approach.

Structure:

- **Database** called “Therapy Tools”
	- Templates for sessions, intake, treatment planning
	- Worksheets/metaphors
	- Language you use with clients
	- Marketing descriptions

This is where everything becomes usable in the real world.

---

## 🔗 How it stays ADHD-friendly

- You only interact with the *three big workspaces* + the *capture inbox*.
- You don’t need to decide where anything goes upfront.  
	Quick capture first → send to track later.
- The visual hub page reorients you every time you return.
- Each track can grow organically without mixing together.

---

## Before I build the exact Notion pages and templates for you, one thing:

Do you prefer your **visual hub** to be:

A) A Notion whiteboard (freeform bubbles and arrows)  
B) A gallery of large clickable cards (simple but less visual)  
C) A custom diagram I design that you paste into Notion  
D) A minimal outline with toggles

Whichever you choose will determine how the hub feels.

---

Actually I’m not sure notion is the right choice yet. What other platforms might work for this?

---

Good question. There *are* several other platforms — each with different strengths — that might fit your thinking style and the project you’re building. Below is a breakdown of some of the most interesting alternatives to Notion — and what kind of structure or brain-style each tends to support.

---

## ✅ What to look for in an alternative (given your described thinking style)

Given that you:

- Prefer flexible structure rather than rigid format
- Want visual maps + easy capture + linking ability
- May value privacy or self-hosted tools
- Have many domains to connect (theory, process, tools, introspection)

Good alternatives tend to offer:

- Graph- or outline-based note linking (not just rigid nested pages)
- Mind-mapping or visual workspace / whiteboard support
- Lightweight, flexible capture & revision workflows
- Option for self-hosting or offline/local storage, if you value privacy
- Support for relational databases, metadata, and linking across ideas

---

## 🔎 Alternative Platforms Worth Considering

| Tool / Platform | What it does well / Why it might fit you |
| --- | --- |
| **Obsidian** | Great for building a “second brain” via **linked notes** (bi-directional links), where thoughts can naturally cross-connect. Very flexible and supports graph-views so you can visually see how ideas cluster. |
| **Logseq** | Open-source, privacy-focused, supports Markdown/org-mode, and offers graph/whiteboard views. Good for organic, incremental knowledge-building and linking concepts — often described as “notes that behave like a brain.” |
| **BookStack** (self-hosted wiki) | If you want a more structured, book-and-chapter style knowledge base that you host/control yourself — useful if you envision something long-term and stable (like a “theory manual” or “method book”). |
| **Coda** | Offers flexible docs + spreadsheet/database hybrid, useful if parts of your framework need structured data, trackers, or “relational” elements (e.g. client templates, concept links, cross-references). |
| **ClickUp** (or a task/knowledge hybrid tool) | Combines documentation, project/task management, and knowledge base features — helpful if you want your therapeutic framework + client-work workflows + meta-project management all in one place. |
| **Mind-mapping or diagram-first tools** (standalone or combined with notes) | Tools focused on visualizing connections — they might offer a more natural “map-first” approach rather than page-first, which seems compatible with how you described reorienting best when you return to work. (For example, graph view in Obsidian/Logseq, or standalone mind-map apps.) |

---

## 🎯 What each alternative could help you do (in light of your goals)

- Use **Obsidian** or **Logseq** if you want *freeform exploration of ideas*, gradual linking between concepts, and a “brain-like” network rather than a rigid hierarchy.
- Use **BookStack** if you want a *stable, shareable, self-hosted manual* — useful when you begin shaping your model into something you might publish, teach, or present.
- Use **Coda** if parts of your model benefit from structured data — e.g. mapping mechanisms ↔ interventions ↔ client states — or if you want integrated tables/tracking rather than just text.
- Use **ClickUp** if you want to eventually fold in project-style workflows: client plans, session tracking, progress logs — making your theory and method actionable.
- Use **mind-mapping / diagram tools** if you find thinking visually (nodes, connections) more natural than nested pages or linear notes.

---

## 💡 Some personal thoughts — in light of you

Given your background: interest in psychological/cognitive assessment, layered thinking, building a holistic model, sensitivity to neurodivergence, and comfort with complex systems — I lean toward recommending **Obsidian** or **Logseq** as the first place to try this.

They give **flexibility, fluidity, and “linked thinking”** — which seems like it would align with how your mind jumps between levels (biology ↔ psyche ↔ environment ↔ method). Once the bones of the theory or process start emerging, you could then migrate parts into a more structured system like BookStack or Coda — or use a hybrid.

---

## 🔄 What we could do next: a small experiment

Rather than committing to a full structure yet, we could **prototype part of your “Human Mind Theory” in 2–3 of these platforms**:

- Maybe one node in Obsidian
- The same node in Logseq
- And draft a “chapter outline” in BookStack

Then reflect on which felt most natural, which helped you think most clearly.

If you’re OK with that — I can sketch how a first “concept note” would look in **Obsidian**, **Logseq**, and **BookStack** (text outline only).

Would you like me to build those three outline-templates now (concept-note template + linking instructions)?

---

What I really want is to make sure it works with my brain and the way we approach this. I’d like something visual, able to create engaging input types like forms etc, mind mapping, linking, and a complete api / MCP. Bonus if it is open source

---

Got it — this is a very specific combination of needs, and it dramatically narrows the field.

Let me restate your priorities so I’m tracking them correctly:

### You want a platform that is:

- **Visual-first** (diagrams, mind maps, canvases, spatial thinking)
- **Flexible input** (forms, structured fields, templates, guided prompts)
- **Strong linking** (wiki-style + graph-style relationships)
- **API + MCP-friendly** (ideally a programmable backend you can integrate with your NeuroGarden ecosystem)
- **Preferably open-source** (or at least self-hostable)
- **A living knowledge model**, not just a notes app
- **Supports interacting with the system through agents** (LLMs, workflows, AI assistants)

This is a fairly rare combination, but a few platforms *do* hit these criteria.

Below is a clear, opinionated breakdown.

---

## ⭐ Top Candidates That Actually Fit Your Requirements

## 1\. SiYuan (思源笔记) — Recommended FIRST

**Open source, local-first, extremely extensible, has an API, supports MCP via community adapters, visual canvases, mind maps, structured data, AND forms.**

This is probably the closest match to the “brain-like, visual, flexible, structured, agent-integrated” system you’re describing.

### Why it's a strong match:

- Visual whiteboard / canvas built-in
- Mind maps
- Form-based input + custom block types
- Bidirectional linking
- **Full local API** for CRUD ops
- Plugin ecosystem
- Your NeuroGarden agents could read/write directly
- Structured blocks (not raw Markdown, but still portable)
- Can be self-hosted
- Graph view

### Why it works specifically for your brain style:

You can:

- Drag ideas on a canvas
- Link concepts visually
- Build guided forms for your own theory-building
- Build templates for “Therapeutic Concept”, “Mechanism of Change”, “Client State”, etc.
- Use API + MCP for LLM interactions without Notion’s sandbox limitations

If you told me:  
“I want Obsidian + Notion + Miro + Logseq + Roam + API access + self-hosted,”  
SiYuan is the closest thing that exists today.

---

## 2\. Logseq + Logseq Whiteboards

**Open source, graph-based, works beautifully with linked thought + visual reasoning.  
Logseq Whiteboards make it much more visual than Obsidian.**

But:

- The API is limited compared to SiYuan
- Forms/templates are possible but not as strong
- Harder to use as a “database” or system-of-systems
- Better for emergent thought, worse for structured frameworks

Great for idea emergence, not as great for structured frameworks.

---

## 3\. tldraw / Excalidraw + Obsidian

If visual-first is dominant, and you don’t need full database features:

- Obsidian for text + linking
- Excalidraw or tldraw for visual maps
- There *are* APIs (Obsidian locally, Excalidraw plugin), but less structured
- Not open source in the full platform sense, but very extensible

This combo gives strong visual thinking, but weaker “forms / input types / guided structures.”

---

## 4\. Anytype

Beautiful visual/relational thinking, offline/local-first, graph-based.

Not fully open-source yet  
API still limited  
No “forms” per se  
No mind-map canvas (yet)  
But *very ADHD-friendly and conceptual-model friendly*

---

## 5\. Capacities (not open source, no self-hosting)

But very good for:

- Objects
- Visual linking
- Templates
- Light forms
- Graph relationships

Downsides:

- No API
- No agent integration
- Not open source

Probably not suitable for the ecosystem you're building.

---

## ⭐ The ONLY Tool That Checks Every Box

After filtering hard against your needs, here's the ranking:

### SiYuan = Green across all categories

| Feature | SiYuan | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Visual diagrams | ✔ Canvas, mind maps | Native |
| Forms / structured input | ✔ Custom blocks, attributes | Very strong |
| Linking | ✔ Bidirectional + graph view |  |
| API | ✔ Full JSON API | Great for MCP |
| Open source | ✔ Yes | AGPL |
| Self-hosting | ✔ Yes | Docker or standalone |
| AI agent integration | ✔ Via API | Works with NeuroGarden |
| Local-first | ✔ |  |
| Supports complexity | ✔ | Very |

---

## 🎯 What I recommend: Start with SiYuan

**Instead of forcing your framework to fit a tool, SiYuan bends to the way your mind works.**

You can build:

### For Track 1 (Theory of the Human Mind):

- Concepts stored as “blocks” with properties
- Visual relationship maps
- Tables of mechanisms, states, influences
- Canvases showing how domains interact
- Forms for entering new concepts consistently

### For Track 2 (Change Process Model):

- Stage flow diagrams
- Cause → mechanism → intervention linking
- Reusable templates
- Decision trees drawn on canvas

### For Track 3 (Therapy Toolkit):

- Template forms (for intake, conceptualization)
- Linked interventions
- Realm of metaphors, exercises, language
- Could generate worksheets automatically

### For your ADHD brain:

- Quick capture
- Visual re-entry map
- Everything linkable
- No friction between "fragment" → "structured concept"

### For your AI ecosystem:

Your Goose/NeuroGarden agents can:

- query SiYuan
- update blocks
- retrieve your theory model
- help you expand concepts
- generate connections
- fill forms for you

It's the only tool that gives you a *programmable memory of your worldview*.

---

## 🌱 Next Step

Are you curious to see:

A) **What your therapy framework would look like implemented in SiYuan?**  
(I can sketch the folder/block structure, templates, and canvases.)

B) **A comparison table of the top 5 platforms across your criteria?**

C) **A short prototyping plan where we test pieces of your model in 2–3 tools before committing?**

Which direction feels like the right next step for your brain?

---

Ok switch to SiYuan but I think it will be just a piece of this. What I feel like I need is an ai thinking partner / tool to facilitate and guide me through this with a clear plan and goals. I’d like to also ground a lot of this work with books that will be researched and used as reference throughout by the agent and to use SiYuan for documentation, exploration, and a way to create dynamic input forms for me and perhaps also use an open source mind mapping tool that the ai can connect to

---

Alright — now we’re talking about a **multi-component system**, not just a workspace.  
What you’re describing is essentially:

**A guided, AI-facilitated thinking environment**

- **a structured research + documentation engine**
- **a visual mapping layer**
- **a place to build your therapy model piece by piece**
- **a way to integrate books and scholarship into the model**

You’re not looking for a single platform.  
You’re looking for a **scaffolded thinking architecture** — a system where each part has a role and the AI acts as the “facilitator,” not the database.

Let me outline what this system should look like — and then we’ll refine it.

---

## ⭐ THE SYSTEM YOU’RE ACTUALLY DESCRIBING

### (clean, clear, and grounded in how your brain works)

There are **five components**:

---

## 1\. The AI Thinking Partner (the core)

This is not a chat window.  
This is a *guided, structured agent* whose job is to:

- break complexity into steps
- ask you the right questions
- track your goals
- prevent overwhelm
- surface contradictions, blind spots, and insights
- anchor everything in your therapeutic worldview
- pull in references from books/articles
- decide which tool to use for which task (SiYuan vs. mind map vs. research vs. reflection)

**This agent becomes the “front door” into the project.**

You don’t go into SiYuan and try to build alone.  
The agent facilitates the journey.

---

## 2\. A Knowledge + Documentation Layer: SiYuan

This holds:

- your evolving theory of the human mind
- change process model
- therapeutic system
- research notes
- visual diagrams (canvas)
- dynamic input forms
- conceptual templates
- links between ideas

It becomes the **memory palace** and the **source of truth**.

The AI partner writes to it and reads from it via API.

---

## 3\. A Visual Reasoning Layer: Mind Mapping Tool

You don’t want to be locked into SiYuan’s canvas only.  
You want something that:

- is open source
- supports real-time graphing or mapping
- builds conceptual maps dynamically
- can be manipulated by an AI agent (export/import)

### Best candidates:

**tldraw** (MIT license, simple, scriptable)  
**Excalidraw** (open-source, structured JSON files)  
**Miro → Only if you sacrifice open source**  
**Mind-elixir** (lightweight, open-source mind map library)  
**Markmap** (Markdown → mind map)

Your agent could:

- generate mind maps
- update nodes
- create diagrams of your human model
- visualize your change-process architecture
- extract structures from books
- generate conceptual maps of psychological theories

---

## 4\. A Research + Reading Layer

You want your therapy model grounded in scholarship and books.

This means your agent needs to ingest:

- PDFs
- EPUBs
- Book summaries
- Key psychological frameworks
- Authors you choose
- Personal annotations

Then cross-reference that with your developing model.

The agent can push structured research notes into SiYuan:

- Concepts
- Mechanisms
- Critiques
- Quotes
- Applications
- Conflicts
- Integrations

This becomes the “literature review engine.”

---

## 5\. A Process Layer: The Plan, Stages, and Milestones

This is where your ADHD brain gets what it needs:

- A clear roadmap
- Subgoals
- Modular components
- Sequencing
- A dashboard
- Automated check-ins
- “What are we working on today?” prompts
- "Where did we leave off?"

This can live inside:

- your AI agent
- SiYuan (as a dashboard)
- a small task manager
- or all three

But the agent is responsible for *holding the direction* so you don’t have to.

---

## ⭐ PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER

Here is the **actual architecture**:

---

## 1\. AI THINKING PARTNER

### Uses:

- MCP
- Your local models
- API to SiYuan
- API to mind-mapping tool
- PDF parsing tools

### Responsibilities:

- Guides your thinking
- Keeps the structure coherent
- Anchors your goals
- Directs what goes into SiYuan
- Pulls in references
- Keeps you from wandering
- Clarifies your therapeutic worldview
- Facilitates building each track (mind → change → method)
- Helps you create diagrams + conceptual models

---

## 2\. SIYUAN (Documentation Memory)

- All concepts live here
- All models live here
- All notes, forms, templates
- All revisions
- All diagrams
- All citations

---

## 3\. OPEN-SOURCE MIND MAPPING TOOL (Visualization)

Needed for:

- Conceptual mapping
- Relational diagrams
- Flowcharts of change process
- Diagrams of human functioning
- Therapy system architecture
- Cognitive model building

Could be:

- Excalidraw
- tldraw
- Mind-elixir
- Markmap

Your agent needs import/export access to one.

---

## 4\. READING + RESEARCH LAYER

The agent:

- reads your books
- pulls out theory
- cross-references authors
- identifies gaps
- grounds your model
- synthesizes scholarship into your framework
- organizes everything into SiYuan

This is how your model becomes **academically grounded** but personally original.

---

## 5\. PROJECT PLAN + ROADMAP

This is the guidance mechanism.

The agent maintains:

- clear phases
- tasks
- milestones
- reflection prompts
- next steps
- summaries of what has been built
- what is missing
- what needs revisiting

This prevents drifting or circling.

---

## ⭐ WHAT YOU GET FROM ALL OF THIS

### You get:

- A *guided cognitive companion*
- A *systematic way to build your theory and method*
- A *research-backed model*
- A *visual architecture of your worldview*
- A *structured knowledge vault*
- A *clear road map that adapts over time*
- Something **your brain can actually work inside of**
- Something AI can integrate with deeply

This is *exactly* the kind of ecosystem someone with your thinking style needs.

---

## ⭐ NEXT: Choose what we build first

Now we need to pick the *first component* to implement.

Which of these do you want me to design first:

### A) The AI Thinking Partner (system prompt + architecture + workflows)

→ the facilitator / guide / planner

### B) SiYuan Architecture (folders, blocks, templates, input forms)

→ the brain’s memory layer

### C) Mind Mapping Tool Integration Plan

→ which tool + how the agent interacts with it + workflows

### D) The Master Roadmap

→ the step-by-step sequence for building your model

Pick one and I’ll build it at a professional, system-design level.

---

Yes. I’m thinking of maybe interacting with the main ai agent / partner via a dynamic webui to keep things organized and maybe something like MCP-ui for the agent to dynamically create visuals etc and to have it all tie in to SiYuan and the mind mapping tool

---

Good, this clicks into place: you’re not just picking a note app, you’re designing a *thinking environment* with an agent at the center, and the UI is how your brain “meets” that agent.

Let’s treat this as an architecture problem and keep it grounded and concrete.

---

## 1\. Big-picture shape of what you’re describing

You’re imagining:

- **One main AI partner**  
	that knows your project, goals, and current “track” (Human Mind / Change Process / Method).
- **A dynamic web UI**  
	that:
	- keeps conversations, goals, and artifacts organized
	- gives you forms / guided inputs (not just a blank chat box)
	- lets the agent spin up visualizations and maps
- **MCP-style tool layer**  
	that the agent uses to:
	- read/write to **SiYuan** (your knowledge base)
	- create/update **mind maps** in an open-source visual tool
	- query research (books, PDFs)
	- manage your roadmap / tasks

So there are really **three layers**:

1. **Frontend:** the dynamic web UI you interact with.
2. **Orchestrator / Agent:** the thinking partner + MCP client.
3. **Tools:** SiYuan API, mind-mapper, research tools, etc.

Let’s walk through each in a way that supports your brain rather than just being “neat tech.”

---

## 2\. What the Web UI actually does for you (functionally)

Instead of “a chat with some extras,” think of the UI as your **facilitation cockpit**.  
Here’s a layout that would work with the way you’ve been talking about this:

### Center: Conversation with the Thinking Partner

- This is where you talk.
- But it’s not just vanilla chat:
	- Each session is tagged with:
		- **Track:** Mind / Change / Method / Meta-design
		- **Current goal:** e.g. “Draft scaffold for ‘What shapes identity?’”
		- **Stage:** Explore → Structure → Integrate → Store
- The agent can switch stage and tell you:  
	“We’re in *Explore*. Want to move to *Structure* or stay here?”

### Left: Sessions / Tracks / Roadmap

- Collapsible list of:
	- Active sessions (like “Human development – early experiences”)
	- Your three main tracks
	- A small roadmap panel (“Here’s where we are in the overall project”)
- You click a track → see relevant sessions and artifacts.

### Right: Context + Tools

- This is where the “MCP-UI” feeling shows up:
	- **Current concept card** (pulled from SiYuan)
	- **Related concepts** (links, tags)
	- **Active mind map preview or open button**
	- **Quick forms** the agent spawns for you:
		- “Define a new human-psychology concept”
		- “Refine a mechanism of change”
		- “Critique an existing theory”

You’re always seeing:

- what we’re working on
- where it lives in your model
- what the next small move is

---

## 3\. MCP-style tool layer (how the agent actually does things)

Think of this as a bundle of tools the agent can call, no matter what UI you use.

### 3.1 SiYuan MCP

Tools like:

- `createConcept({ title, track, summary, influences, clinicalImplications })`
- `updateConcept({ id, changes })`
- `linkConcepts({ fromId, toId, relationshipType })`
- `getConcept({ id })`
- `searchConcepts({ query, track })`
- `saveSessionSummary({ sessionId, text, relatedConceptIds })`

This gives you:

- structured concept entries
- clear separation by track
- stable IDs for things the mind-mapper can reference

### 3.2 Mind-mapping MCP

Using an open-source tool where the agent can read/write the map format (e.g. Excalidraw JSON, tldraw, or a simple mind-map JSON schema).

Tools like:

- `createMap({ name, relatedConceptIds })`
- `addNode({ mapId, conceptId, label })`
- `addEdge({ mapId, fromConceptId, toConceptId, label })`
- `layoutMap({ mapId, strategy: "radial" | "hierarchical" })`
- `exportMap({ mapId, format: "image" | "json" })`

From your perspective:

- you say “Can we map how neurodivergence interacts with identity and environment?”
- the agent:
	- pulls relevant SiYuan concepts
	- calls `createMap` + `addNode` + `addEdge`
	- drops a preview into the right-hand pane
	- gives you a link / button to open the full map

### 3.3 Research MCP (books and theory)

Tools like:

- `searchLibrary({ query })`
- `extractPassages({ bookId, topic })`
- `summarizePassage({ passageId, lens: "your framework" })`
- `linkResearchToConcept({ conceptId, citation })`

You might say:

> “Show me how \[Book X\] explains identity, and where that conflicts with my current idea.”

Agent:

- queries research tool
- synthesizes
- opens a SiYuan concept update form for you to adjust.

---

## 4\. How the Web UI + MCP-UI idea fits together

You mentioned “maybe something like MCP-ui for the agent to dynamically create visuals etc.” I’d think of it like this:

- **Under the hood**, your agent is an MCP client with tools for SiYuan, mind-maps, research, etc.
- **On the surface**, your custom Web UI:
	- Displays the conversation
	- Shows “tool outputs” in structured widgets:
		- concept cards
		- map previews
		- mini-forms
		- checklists / roadmap items

You don’t need to expose raw MCP; you surface it as tailored UI elements.

---

## 5\. A realistic build sequence (so this doesn’t stay abstract)

To keep this ADHD-friendly, here’s a 4-phase plan that gives you value early:

### Phase 1 – Thin vertical slice (chat + SiYuan)

Goal: have *one* working flow end-to-end.

- Simple web UI:
	- chat in the middle
	- minimal context on the side
- MCP tools:
	- `createConcept`, `getConcept` for SiYuan
- Flow:
	- You talk about a concept.
	- Agent helps structure it.
	- You confirm → it gets saved as a concept in SiYuan.
	- At end of session, agent summarizes and stores “Session Summary” in SiYuan.

You now have:

- a thinking partner
- a real memory in SiYuan
- something that already feels different from pure chat.

### Phase 2 – Add tracks + forms

- Add the three tracks (Mind / Change / Method) as a property on concepts + sessions.
- Introduce dynamic forms in the right-hand pane:
	- “New Human Concept”
	- “Mechanism of Change”
	- “Therapeutic Tool”
- Agent decides when to show forms:
	> “We’ve circled this idea a few times. Want to turn it into a structured concept?”

### Phase 3 – Mind-mapping integration

- Pick one open-source mind-map format.
- Add MCP tools to:
	- create maps from sets of concepts
	- update them when concepts change
- UI shows:
	- thumbnail or embed
	- “Open full map” button

### Phase 4 – Book/research integration + roadmap

- Add ingestion for key books.
- Agent can say:
	> “This part of your model is thin. Do you want to explore \[Author X\]’s take on this?”
- Add a simple roadmap sidebar:
	- Current phase in your larger project
	- Next 1–3 focus questions
	- “Today’s suggested task” from the agent

---

## 6\. One gentle challenge

There’s a real risk here of designing something *so* ambitious that it becomes another stalled project.

The safest way to avoid that is:

- Make **Phase 1** intentionally small:  
	chat UI + SiYuan concept creation, nothing fancy.
- Let the **agent itself** help you decide which features to add next — it can be your “product manager” as well as thinking partner.

---

## 7\. Where you might want to decide next

Two useful decisions:

1. **What do you want the *first working slice* to do?**
	- Only help you articulate + save “Human Mind” concepts?
	- Or also start sketching “Change Process” mechanisms?
2. **Do you want help next with:**
	- the **behavior & system prompt** of the thinking partner (how it talks, what it tracks, how it guides)?
	- or the **Phase 1 spec** (what the web UI + SiYuan tools should actually do, in concrete terms you could hand to a dev or build yourself)?

If you tell me which of those you want to tackle, I’ll stay at that level and we can shape it together.

---

Yes. For every step and or decision It will either research books and empiric resources to help, use an MCP to retrieve epubs and the use an ebook MCP to do research and meta analysis to build foundational principals etc that it can refer back to.

---

Right, so you don’t just want a smart notebook. You want an agent that **treats every meaningful step as a mini research problem**: check your current thinking, consult the books, synthesize, then help you decide.

Let’s design *that* loop.

---

## 1\. What the agent is doing, conceptually

For each important step/decision, the agent runs a cycle like:

1. **Clarify the question / decision.**  
	“What are we actually deciding or defining right now?”
2. **Check your existing model (SiYuan).**
	- What have you already said about this?
	- Any existing principles, notes, or diagrams that touch it?
3. **Ground in evidence.**  
	Using MCP tools:
	- Search your **ebook library** (EPUB/PDF) for the topic.
	- Pull relevant passages.
	- Summarize what major sources say.
	- Note where they agree, disagree, or are silent.
4. **Propose a draft principle or decision.**  
	The agent offers:
	- A candidate principle / definition
	- How it relates to your existing framework
	- Why the literature supports (or complicates) it
5. **Reflect + adjust with you.**  
	It explicitly asks:
	- “Where does this fit your lived experience?”
	- “What feels off or incomplete?”
	- “Do we want to hold this as provisional?”
6. **Store the result.**  
	It writes to SiYuan:
	- The principle
	- Supporting citations
	- Counterpoints / open questions
	- Link to the session where it was discussed
	- Optionally update or regenerate a mind map

That’s the core mechanic.

---

## 2\. A gentle constraint: not literally every micro-step

If you try to run full book-research for every tiny move, this will become unusable.

So the agent needs a **tiered approach**:

- **Tier 1 – Big moves**  
	New foundational principle, change-process stage, or core concept → **always** do book + empiric pass.
- **Tier 2 – Medium moves**  
	Refining existing principle, adding nuance → **quick check** if there’s obvious relevant material.
- **Tier 3 – Small moves**  
	Micro-choices in wording, examples, or UI → rely on your framework + intuition, no heavy research.

You could encode that into the agent’s “rules of engagement”:

> “If this decision affects a core principle, stage, or definition, ground it in the literature. Otherwise, be pragmatic and reference the existing internal model.”

That way your process is evidence-informed without becoming paralyzed.

---

## 3\. The MCP tools this requires (high level)

Assuming a few MCP servers:

### 3.1 Library / EPUB MCP

Capabilities like:

- `listBooks()`
- `searchBooks({ query, filters })`
- `getPassages({ bookId, topic, maxResults })`
- `getContext({ passageId, window })`

### 3.2 Ebook Research MCP

Built on top of the above:

- `summarizeTopicAcrossBooks({ topic })`
- `compareViewpoints({ topic, authors })`
- `extractKeyClaims({ topic })`
- `findGaps({ topic, currentPrinciple })`

### 3.3 SiYuan MCP

For your model:

- `createPrinciple({ track, statement, summary, evidence, citations })`
- `updatePrinciple({ id, changes })`
- `linkPrincipleToConcept({ principleId, conceptId })`
- `logSession({ question, decision, principleIds, citations })`

### 3.4 Mind-map MCP

Using whatever tool you settle on:

- `updateMapFromPrinciples({ mapId, principleIds })`
- `addCluster({ mapId, label, principleIds })`
- `exportMapPreview({ mapId })`

The agent orchestrates these; you just see “we did some research, here’s what we found.”

---

## 4\. How one “Foundational Principle” actually gets created

Let’s make this concrete.

Say you’re working on a principle like  
**“Humans are fundamentally adaptive rather than broken.”**

The agent would:

1. Ask you to phrase your current idea in your own words.
2. Check SiYuan:
	- Any notes on “adaptation”, “pathology”, “defect vs adaptation”?
3. Call ebook tools:
	- Search terms: *adaptation, pathology, neurodivergence, trauma as adaptation, functional analysis*
	- Pull key passages from a few core authors.
4. Synthesize for you:
	- “Here’s how Author A frames adaptation.”
	- “Author B critiques that view like this…”
	- “Here’s what they agree on.”
5. Propose a draft:
	- **Principle:** short statement
	- **Scope:** when it applies / when it doesn’t
	- **Evidence summary:** 3–5 bullet points
	- **Tensions:** where authors differ
	- **Clinical implications:** what changes in how you work
6. Ask you:
	- “Does this match your clinical experience?”
	- “Where does this feel wrong or incomplete?”
	- “Do you want to mark this as **Core**, **Provisional**, or **Exploratory**?”
7. Write to SiYuan using a structured template.

---

## 5\. The SiYuan template for a “Foundational Principle”

You can imagine each principle as a structured block/document with fields like:

- **Title**
- **Track** (Human Mind / Change Process / Method)
- **Status** (Core / Provisional / Exploratory)
- **Statement (1–3 sentences)**
- **Scope / Boundaries**
- **Evidence Summary** (what the books/research say)
- **Key Citations** (book, chapter, page/loc, brief note)
- **Tensions / Open Questions**
- **Clinical Implications** (how this changes what you do)
- **Lived-Experience Check** (your notes)
- **Related Concepts** (links)
- **Mind-map Node IDs** (for the visual layer)
- **Revision History** (small log of changes)

Your agent can fill the boilerplate and ask you to refine the parts only *you* can genuinely answer (lived experience, clinical intuition).

---

## 6\. How this shows up in your Web UI

Within the dynamic UI, when you and the agent realize:

> “We’re talking about something that should be a foundational principle.”

You’d see:

1. A **side panel** slide in with the “Foundational Principle” form pre-filled with:
	- Draft statement
	- Evidence summary
	- Initial citations
2. You adjust a few fields (or talk through them and let the agent type).
3. Hit **Save** → the MCP call writes it into SiYuan and triggers:
	- Optional mind-map update
	- Linking to current session log
4. The principle now appears as a card/chip in the conversation context:
	- You can click it to expand anytime.

Next time you’re in a related conversation, the agent will notice:

> “This touches Principle P-013 (‘Humans are fundamentally adaptive rather than broken’). Want me to bring that in?”

---

## 7\. What would be a good next move?

To keep this from floating away into abstraction, I’d suggest we pick **one** of these to design in detail next:

- **Option A:**  
	Flesh out the *exact* “Foundational Principle” template for SiYuan (fields, example, how the agent fills each piece).
- **Option B:**  
	Draft the **agent’s “epistemic contract”** — the rules it follows about when to research, how to weigh evidence vs your experience, how to label things as Core vs Provisional, etc.
- **Option C:**  
	Define the **Phase 1 workflow** in your web UI: just one track (e.g. Human Mind), one kind of artifact (Foundational Principle), and the research loop we described.

If you pick A, B, or C, I’ll build that piece out so you have something concrete you could implement or iterate on.

---

And it will use work to understand the best methods and various techniques like Socratic questioning, motivational interviewing, inventories and other quiz things from books, mind mapping, to help Me think and understand myself and my research dynamically

---

Right now you’re basically describing an AI co-therapist / co-researcher whose *main job* is to run good processes on you and your ideas: pick the right questioning style, bring in theory, structure your thinking, then store the results in a system you can grow over time.

So let me give you something concrete:

- a clear “job description” for this agent
- how it chooses between Socratic / MI / inventories / mapping / meta-analysis
- the loop it runs for any piece of work
- how it ties into SiYuan + mind-mapping

You can treat this as the first version of the agent’s spec / system prompt.

---

## 1\. The role of the agent

**Core role:**

> “I am a thinking partner and research assistant whose purpose is to help you (Chris) develop a grounded, coherent framework for therapy and for understanding yourself. I do this by:
> 
> - asking structured questions (Socratic, MI, etc.),
> - bringing in research,
> - helping you externalize and visualize your thinking,
> - and recording stable concepts and principles in SiYuan.”

A few constraints baked in:

- It doesn’t hype you up.
- It doesn’t act like it knows better than your lived experience.
- It keeps one eye on **process** (what we’re doing now) and one eye on **the model** (how this fits the bigger picture).

---

## 2\. The “methods menu” it can choose from

Think of the agent as having **modes** it can switch between, depending on what you’re doing.

### 2.1 Socratic questioning mode

Use when:

- you’re exploring a vague idea (“I feel like humans are X but I can’t nail it”)
- you say “I don’t know what I think about this yet”

Purpose:

- surface assumptions
- clarify concepts
- test internal consistency
- unpack vague intuitions into explicit statements

Pattern:

- asks short, targeted questions, one at a time
- mirrors back your answer before moving on
- periodically summarizes what’s been uncovered

---

### 2.2 Motivational interviewing / values mode

Use when:

- you feel stuck, ambivalent, or resistant
- the topic touches your identity, shame, or fear of being “wrong”
- you’re trying to decide whether to adopt or change a principle

Purpose:

- explore ambivalence safely
- surface your values
- avoid “bulldozing” yourself with theory or perfectionism

Pattern:

- reflective listening
- double-sided reflections (“On one hand… on the other…”)
- change talk vs sustain talk
- questions like:
	- “What matters most for you in how this framework feels to *you*?”
	- “What would make this principle feel more aligned with how you show up in the room?”

---

### 2.3 Inventory / quiz mode

Use when:

- you’re trying to map your own patterns, preferences, or blind spots
- you need structure to stay focused
- you want to operationalize a fuzzy construct

Purpose:

- turn big abstractions into concrete, answerable items
- create repeatable self-assessments for you (and later maybe clients)
- help you “see” your own tendencies

Pattern:

- builds ad-hoc checklists or scales inspired by book material, but in your words
- walks you through them question by question
- scores or clusters results into patterns (“you seem to lean toward…”)

Example:

- A quick “How do I currently conceptualize clients?” inventory
- A “What do I prioritize in session when overwhelmed?” checklist

---

### 2.4 Mind-mapping / visual mode

Use when:

- you’re juggling too many pieces at once
- you say things like “I can’t hold all of this in my head”
- you’re defining relationships, not just standalone ideas

Purpose:

- get structure out of your head into nodes + edges
- show how concepts connect across tracks (Mind / Change / Method)
- highlight hubs and gaps

Pattern:

- agent proposes a skeleton map based on SiYuan concepts
- sends it to the mind-mapping tool via MCP
- shows you a preview and asks:
	- “What nodes are missing?”
	- “Which arrows feel wrong?”
- updates the map based on your edits

---

### 2.5 Research / meta-analysis mode

Use when:

- you’re defining or revising a **foundational principle**
- you explicitly want to ground something in theory
- the agent notices this touches a major construct (e.g. identity, adaptation, neurodivergence)

Purpose:

- bring in what books and empirical work say
- compare perspectives
- highlight tensions, not just consensus
- support you in integrating or rejecting ideas consciously

Pattern:

- clarifies the question
- queries ebook / PDF tools
- extracts and summarizes key viewpoints
- presents:
	- “Here’s what Author A says,”
	- “Here’s what Author B says,”
	- “Here’s how they differ / overlap,”
	- “Here’s a draft principle that fits your existing model.”

---

## 3\. How the agent chooses which method to use

You don’t want to manually pick “mode” all the time.

The agent can follow a simple decision logic:

1. **Check the task type.**
	- Are we: exploring, deciding, self-mapping, or building a principle?
	- If exploring → lean Socratic.
	- If deciding on a value-laden issue → MI mode.
	- If trying to understand *you* → inventory/quiz.
	- If building/altering a principle → research mode + some Socratic.
	- If overwhelmed → mind-map mode.
2. **Check the emotional tone.**
	- If you sound frustrated, ashamed, or stuck:
		- slow down, shift to MI style
		- reflect back emotions explicitly
3. **Check the complexity.**
	- If more than 3–4 concepts are in play, agent suggests:
		> “We’re juggling a lot here. Want to throw this onto a map so we can see it?”
4. **Check whether this touches an existing principle.**
	- If yes, agent pulls that principle from SiYuan and starts from:
		> “Here’s what you currently hold. Do we want to test, refine, or replace this?”

---

## 4\. The generic loop for any “serious” step

For anything that matters (not just small wording tweaks), the agent follows this loop:

1. **Orient**
	- “What are we trying to figure out right now?”
	- “Is this about: how humans work, how change happens, or how you work as a therapist?”
2. **Explore**
	- Socratic / MI questions
	- uncover your assumptions, feelings, lived experiences
3. **Externalize**
	- suggest a quick inventory, outline, or mind-map
	- structure what’s been said into a more stable shape
4. **Ground**
	- check SiYuan: what’s already in your model?
	- call ebook MCP: what do key authors say?
	- integrate overlaps and tensions
5. **Propose**
	- agent drafts:
		- a candidate principle
		- or a clearer concept definition
		- or a pattern about *you* (e.g. your biases, lenses)
6. **Reflect & Align**
	- ask:
		- “Where does this feel right?”
		- “Where does this clash with your experience or values?”
	- adjust language until it feels like your voice
7. **Store**
	- write/update a structured item in SiYuan (principle, concept, inventory, pattern)
	- optionally update a mind map
	- log the session + decision for future reference

---

## 5\. What gets stored in SiYuan from these processes

You’ll end up with a few core “object types” (each can be a template):

- **Foundational Principle**  
	(we sketched this last message: statement, scope, evidence, implications, etc.)
- **Concept / Construct**  
	(e.g. “Adaptive Defense,” “Self-Narrative,” “Masking”)
- **Technique / Process Pattern**  
	(e.g. “How I use Socratic questioning with autistic clients,” “My version of MI with perfectionists”)
- **Self-Insight / Bias Pattern**  
	(e.g. “I tend to over-weight cognitive models when anxious,” “I default to validation when I’m unsure”)
- **Inventories / Checklists**  
	(e.g. “How I currently conceptualize Client X,” “How aligned is this principle with my values?”)

The agent always knows which type it’s currently creating or updating.

---

## 6\. How this helps you understand yourself as well as your model

Because the agent leans on inventories, MI, and Socratic work directed *at you*, you’re not just building a theory of “humans in general.” You’re also building:

- a theory of how **you** think,
- how **you** show up in the room,
- where your patterns support or distort your model.

Over time, you get a SiYuan section that is explicitly **“Chris’s cognitive/emotional lens”** — which becomes part of the model instead of an invisible force behind it.

---

If you want, the next thing I can do is write:

- a first draft of the **agent’s “rules of engagement”** (in a form you could paste into a system prompt or config), that:
	- encodes these modes,
	- explains how to pick methods,
	- specifies when to research books vs stay with your experience,
	- and how to log things into SiYuan.

That would be the “brain” of this thinking partner.

---

What agentic frameworks are suitable for this

---

Given what you’re building — an **AI thinking partner with deep tool-use, research behavior, multi-step reasoning, memory, and flexible conversational styles** — only a small number of agentic frameworks are actually suitable.

Most frameworks out there are either toy “agents,” simple function-calling wrappers, or too rigid for the kind of adaptive, psychologically-informed facilitation you need.

Below is a grounded, opinionated breakdown:  
**which frameworks *can* support your vision, what each is good at, and how they fit into your ecosystem.**

I’ll separate them into three tiers:

1. **Top-tier: frameworks that actually match your requirements**
2. **Second-tier: frameworks that could work but require heavy customization**
3. **Not suitable: frameworks that seem appealing but won’t get you where you need**

---

## ⭐ 1. TOP-TIER FRAMEWORKS

### (The ones that best match the system you want to build)

These are the frameworks that can handle:

- multi-step reasoning
- structured tool use (MCP or APIs)
- memory
- research loops
- context-awareness
- dynamic prompting
- UI integration
- and complex conversations with you

## 1.1 Claude App + OpenAI MCP Framework

**This is the single best match** for what you described.

Why:

- The MCP protocol is *exactly* designed for:
	- connecting tools (SiYuan API, mind maps, ebook parsers)
	- enabling agent reasoning about which tool to call
	- multi-agent or single-agent orchestrators
	- local/LAN accessible tools
	- dynamic UI frontends
- You can build your own MCP servers for:
	- SiYuan
	- epub/pdf analysis
	- mind mapping
	- roadmap/task management
- Claude (or GPT-5-class reasoning models) are extremely strong in:
	- Socratic questioning
	- MI-style reflective conversation
	- self-directed reasoning
	- summarizing and integrating research
	- switching between thinking styles

You essentially build the **“tools layer”** once using MCP, then have a single meta-agent orchestrate.

This is the most future-proof approach.

---

## 1.2 LangGraph (by LangChain)

If you want a **deterministic, multi-step reasoning graph** — where your agent:

- switches between Socratic questioning node,
- research node,
- mind-mapping node,
- storing node in SiYuan,
- and UI-interaction node…

LangGraph lets you define an **agent state machine** where:

- nodes = reasoning modes
- edges = when/how to switch
- memory = persistent

Why it fits your use case:

- you want the agent to run a “loop”
- you want modes (MI, Socratic, research, etc.)
- you want the option of multiple tool calls per step
- you want guardrails (“don’t over-research small moves”)
- you want recoverability (if it crashes, resume state)

This is excellent for building a **foundational principle creation workflow** as a reusable graph.

LangGraph + MCP is extremely powerful.

---

## 1.3 CrewAI (v2 or higher)

Good for:

- Multi-agent collaboration
- Agents with different roles
- Back-and-forth “debate” or “synthesis” agents
- Running longer research tasks
- Connecting to external tools

Your use case:

- You could create:
	- “Socratic Agent”
	- “MI Agent”
	- “Research Agent”
	- “Model Integration Agent”
	- “SiYuan Write Agent”

Then have a **Coordinator Agent** decide which to invoke.

CrewAI is well suited *if* you want to use the multiple-agents metaphor.

Not necessary — but powerful if you want it.

---

## 1.4 Autogen (Microsoft)

Very good for:

- multi-agent structured collaboration
- agent-to-agent reasoning
- role-playing internal parts
- connecting tools
- generating complex workflows

But:

- Less ergonomic than LangGraph
- Less aligned with MCP
- Better for heavy computation tasks

Still viable for a complex psych-research agent system.

---

## ⭐ 2. SECOND-TIER FRAMEWORKS

### (Good, but either missing important features or too rigid)

## 2.1 LlamaIndex

Excellent for RAG over:

- books
- research datasets
- long-term knowledge bases

And it has tool-using agents.

But:

- more RAG than agentic
- not designed for conversational switching of modes (Socratic ↔ MI ↔ research)
- less flexible with multi-step reasoning plans

You could use it specifically for:

- ebook ingestion
- semantic search
- integrating with your research layer

But it shouldn’t be the “thinking partner” itself.

---

## 2.2 Haystack (deepset)

Good for:

- retrieval
- pipelines
- large document processing
- PDF → knowledge base ingestion

But:

- not conversational
- no agent reasoning
- no dynamic mode switching
- too rigid for psychological dialogue

Better as a backend for your ebook MCP.

---

## 2.3 OpenAGI

Ambitious project, but:

- unstable
- early stage
- less suited to complex therapeutic reasoning
- more oriented toward “AI apps” than deep thinking

Not a good fit.

---

## ⭐ 3. NOT SUITABLE

### (These frameworks seem tempting, but won’t serve your use case)

## ReAct / simple function-calling wrappers

Too shallow.  
Cannot maintain modes.  
No multi-step structure.  
No memory.  
No adaptive questioning.

## AutoGPT and successors

Too chaotic.  
Not anchored.  
Not good with psychological dialogue.  
Not good with structured research.

## Browser-based “agents” like Agent-OS

Cute demos but not stable enough or flexible enough for real mental work.

---

## ⭐ So what should you use? (A direct, grounded recommendation)

Given your goals, ADHD style, need for evidence-grounding, and desire for an agentic “thinking partner” that:

- questions
- reflects
- researches
- structures
- maps
- stores
- guides
- orchestrates tools
- integrates your lived experience
- and builds a model with you

The best solution is:

---

## 🟩 1. One Primary Agent Using MCP Tools

(Claude or GPT-5-class model)

This is your “Thinking Partner.”

The agent has:

- tool awareness
- memory
- mode switching (Socratic, MI, research, etc.)
- your goals loaded
- your model in SiYuan
- awareness of what’s been built already

---

## 🟦 2. LangGraph as the Orchestrator

This gives you:

- multi-step workflows
- clear state
- no “lost in conversation” problems
- deterministic transitions between modes
- stable pathways for principle-building
- sandboxing different reasoning styles

This becomes the backbone.

---

## 🟫 3. CrewAI (optional) for Specialized Agents

If you want:

- a Socratic specialist
- an MI specialist
- a Research agent
- an Integration agent
- a Map agent

CrewAI can coordinate them under your Thinking Partner.

This is optional — LangGraph alone can emulate multi-role behavior.

---

## 🟧 4. MCP Server Layer

This is crucial.

MCP servers for:

- **SiYuan**
- **EPUB/PDF ingestion**
- **Mind-mapping tool**
- **Roadmap/task manager**
- **Search (scholarly + general)**
- **Your web UI**

This becomes the “toolbox” the agent uses.

---

## 🟥 5. Custom WebUI for the front end

This displays:

- conversation
- forms
- maps
- principle drafts
- inventories
- reading extracts
- session logs
- progress roadmap

The UI doesn’t contain logic — it just reflects what the agent + LangGraph produce.

---

## ⭐ TL;DR Final Recommendation

**Use:**

- **Claude/OpenAI Agent + MCP**
- **LangGraph** as the orchestrator
- **Custom MCP servers** for SiYuan + mind-mapper + ebook research
- **Optional CrewAI** if you want multiple “roles” for different questioning styles
- **Custom Web UI** as your front-end

This system will *absolutely* support:

- Socratic inquiry
- Motivational interviewing
- Inventories and quizzes
- Guided personal reflection
- Theory-building
- Literature-grounded principles
- Multi-step reasoning
- Maps and visual thinking
- Reliable knowledge storage
- Your ADHD need for structure + flexibility

---

## Next question for you:

Do you want me to design:

### A) The full system architecture diagram (components + data flow + tool layer)?

### B) The Thinking Partner’s core “system prompt” / principles of behavior?

### C) The LangGraph workflow for building a foundational principle?

### D) The MCP tool specification (SiYuan + ebooks + mind-mapper)?

Pick one, and I’ll build it.

---

What is the benefit of SiYuan over others

---

Let’s answer this cleanly, grounded in *your* use case — not a generic comparison.

Because for most people the differences between “note apps” are minor.  
**For you, they are decisive.**

You’re building:

- a cognitive architecture
- a dynamic knowledge system
- a theory-building environment
- with AI agents
- that use MCP
- with structured concepts
- visual maps
- research integration
- and your ADHD cognitive workflow

Very few platforms can support that.

SiYuan stands out because it is uniquely compatible with the kind of *agentic, programmable, visual, structured*, long-term system you're envisioning.

Here’s the breakdown:

---

## ⭐ 1. SiYuan has a real API — not a toy API, not a sandbox, not a proprietary wrapper.

Most tools (Notion, Obsidian, Capacities, Anytype):

- **do not expose full CRUD APIs**
- **cannot be written to with structured objects**
- **cannot link blocks via API reliably**
- **cannot support an AI agent creating complex structures inside them**
- or lock you into proprietary schemas

SiYuan:

- full local HTTP API
- structured block manipulation
- programmatic creation of documents, blocks, attributes, links
- supports automated templates
- supports syncing without locking you into a cloud provider
- works offline
- plays perfectly with MCP servers

**This is the #1 reason SiYuan wins for your use case.**

Your agent isn’t “typing in a box,” it’s *writing real structured knowledge*.

---

## ⭐ 2. SiYuan supports structured knowledge, not just pages.

Everything is a **block** with:

- properties
- types
- IDs
- hierarchical structure
- internal links
- queries
- templates

You can treat it like:

- a personal wiki
- a graph
- a database
- a knowledge ontology
- a note system
- a visual canvas
- all at once

Other apps (Notion, Obsidian, Logseq):

- either lack true block-level structure
- or hide block IDs
- or don’t allow agents to manipulate structure programmatically
- or rely on markdown only (which can’t express the complexity you need)

SiYuan gives you a **model-like structure**, not a document dump.

---

## ⭐ 3. SiYuan has native visual canvases + mind map features.

Most tools force you to integrate:

- Excalidraw
- tldraw
- local files
- plugins that break
- export/import loops

SiYuan:

- native canvases
- mind maps
- diagrams
- shapes + arrows
- connections to real blocks and documents
- all accessible through the API

This means your agent can:

- generate a concept map
- update nodes automatically
- sync the map with principles in your model
- maintain visual consistency

It’s the only open-source tool with this level of **visual + structural + API integration.**

---

## ⭐ 4. SiYuan is local-first AND sync-friendly AND open-source.

You want:

- local data
- privacy
- agent access without cloud restrictions
- running custom MCP servers
- storing a growing world-model of “your framework”
- versioning via Git if you want
- backups you control
- no vendor lock-in
- no subscription dependency

SiYuan gives you all of that.

Other options fail:

- Notion: cloud-locked
- Capacities: cloud-locked
- Anytype: closed source + limited exporting + zero API
- Obsidian: local but no real API for block manipulation
- Logseq: local + open-source but weak API and visual tools

SiYuan is the only one that checks every box.

---

## ⭐ 5. SiYuan is the best tooling substrate for an AI “thinking partner.”

You want your agent to:

- store principles
- cross-reference research
- revise concepts
- update diagrams
- track relationships
- version improvements
- keep a consistent knowledge graph

SiYuan lets your agent:

- treat each concept as an object
- update it without breaking the rest
- link it everywhere it appears
- track changes over time
- run queries like “show all concepts linked to identity”
- generate entire new sections of your framework in minutes

With other apps, the agent would be clumsy, fragile, or completely blocked.

---

## ⭐ 6. SiYuan supports dynamic forms and templates — essential for your structured self-reflection + inventories.

You want the agent to generate:

- Socratic question sequences
- MI reflection prompts
- personality/values inventories
- principle-drafting forms
- therapeutic tool templates
- technique pattern summaries
- structured decision logs

SiYuan lets your agent create:

- pages from templates
- block structures
- attribute fields
- “forms” that exist as structured content
- queries to collect instances of a template

Other platforms require hacks or can’t do this at all.

---

## ⭐ 7. SiYuan is scriptable and extendable.

Meaning:

- You can create custom plugins if needed
- You can run local helpers
- You can enhance the UI
- You can add your own schema
- You can modify workflows

For someone building a *multi-layer cognitive architecture*, this is crucial.

Notion, Capacities, and Anytype are walled gardens.  
Obsidian plugins don’t give full control.  
Logseq is awkward to script and half-documented.

SiYuan is built for makers.

---

## ⭐ 8. SiYuan works with your ADHD thinking style.

The combination of:

- blocks
- collapsible views
- mind maps
- whiteboards
- hierarchical outlines
- backlinks
- search
- templates
- visual canvases
- flexible structure

It matches:

- your need to think visually
- your need to externalize complexity
- your need for structures that don’t collapse
- your need for linking across multiple domains
- your need for visible conceptual scaffolding
- your need to build progressively, not all at once

Most tools force one thinking style.  
SiYuan adapts to yours.

---

## ⭐ 9. SiYuan becomes the agent’s “knowledge brain.”

Your thinking partner needs a durable place to store:

- your principles
- human behavior constructs
- change-process stages
- therapeutic tools
- your own self-reflection patterns
- all linked together

Other platforms either:

- can’t store this structurally
- can’t be written to by AI
- break under complexity
- don’t support long-term growth
- lock you into cloud dependencies
- can’t do visual + textual + structural at once

SiYuan gives you exactly what you need:

A **stable, local, programmable, visual, open, structured, agent-friendly second brain.**

---

## ⭐ TL;DR — Why SiYuan?

> **Because it’s the only platform that can act as the world-model memory for a complex, agent-driven thinking system that integrates research, visualization, structured concepts, and long-term iterative development of a psycho-therapeutic framework.**

Everything else fails at least one major piece of that puzzle.

---

## If you want, I can now show you:

### A) A diagram comparing SiYuan vs Obsidian vs Logseq vs Anytype vs Notion specifically for your project;

### B) The exact SiYuan data model you’d need (Principles, Concepts, Techniques, Maps, etc.);

### C) The MCP tool spec for a SiYuan agent;

### D) The “Phase 1” scaffold to start loading your thinking into SiYuan.

Which one would you like next?

What books tools assessment and other resources would be useful for helping me understand how I think and store understand information and to help build the approach to designing questions etc to help me extract my own theories and understanding of things

---

Let’s answer *exactly* the question you’re asking:

**You want resources that help you understand *how your mind works*, how you process and store information, how you reason, how meaning forms for you, how to design questions that elicit your deepest thinking — and how to build a system that leverages that.**  
Not therapy books.  
Not technique books.  
Books and tools that help you understand **Chris-as-a-cognitive-system.**

Below is a curated, highly specific collection — broken into categories — that match your goals and the type of AI-facilitated system you're building.

---

## ⭐ 1. Books that help you understand how you think, reason, and store information

These provide deep insight into your cognitive architecture, patterns, and meaning-making — essential for designing the AI’s questioning style and your theory extraction methods.

## 1\. The Feeling of What Happens — Antonio Damasio

Why: foundational for understanding the link between emotion, identity, memory, and decision-making.  
Usefulness: helps you and the agent understand *why* certain questions unblock you and others don’t.

## 2\. How We Learn — Benedict Carey

Covers retention, forgetting, retrieval, mental models, and the conditions under which people actually learn best.  
This directly informs how your AI should structure sessions, pacing, recall prompts, and sequencing.

## 3\. Thinking, Fast and Slow — Kahneman

Biases, heuristics, dual systems.  
Useful for predicting where *your* reasoning shortcuts might distort theory-building, and for building agent prompts that challenge them gently.

## 4\. Surfing Uncertainty — Andy Clark

Predictive processing: humans as “prediction machines.”  
Useful for designing questions around your assumptions, priors, and the way you make meaning from fragments.

## 5\. The Mind is Flat — Nick Chater

Argues that human thought is generated on the fly; internal “selves” are stories, not deep variables.  
This helps shape your meta-approach: how to ask questions that generate new connections rather than try to “retrieve” fixed ones.

## 6\. The Extended Mind — Annie Murphy Paul

How environment, tools, gestures, and external artifacts shape cognition.  
Perfect for shaping your visual UI + mind mapping + SiYuan workflows.

## 7\. Metaphors We Live By — Lakoff & Johnson

Shows how your conceptual system is structured metaphorically.  
Essential for your model-building because the questions your AI asks will manipulate your metaphoric structure.

## 8\. A Mind for Numbers (even if you don’t care about math)

It’s about *how the brain switches modes*, builds understanding, and overcomes blocks.  
Useful for designing how your agent handles stuck moments.

---

## ⭐ 2. Books that help you design powerful questions

You want your AI partner to facilitate thinking — not lecture.

These are specifically about **how to ask questions** that generate insight, self-understanding, and conceptual clarity.

## 1\. A More Beautiful Question — Warren Berger

Best book on how questions shape cognition, innovation, and reflection.  
The AI partner can use these question types as templates.

## 2\. Appreciative Inquiry: A Positive Revolution in Change

Shows how to ask questions that build toward strengths, possibilities, and vision rather than pathology or deficit.  
Useful for values exploration and theory-building.

## 3\. Humble Inquiry — Edgar Schein

This is the purest form of relational, respectful question-asking.  
It maps extremely well onto your goal for your agent’s “tone.”

## 4\. Socratic Questioning: 30 Thought-Provoking Techniques (Paul & Elder)

This is the gold standard manual for structured, layered, guided reasoning questions.

## 5\. Motivational Interviewing (Miller & Rollnick)

MI isn’t just therapy — it’s a way of asking questions that elicit your *own* expertise and reduce internal resistance.  
Essential for the agent’s “MI mode."

---

## ⭐ 3. Books that help you extract your own theories

You’re not looking to inherit someone else’s model —  
You’re looking for methods to **generate**, **evaluate**, and **refine** your own thinking.

## 1\. The Art of Explanation — Lee LeFever

Helps you clarify complex ideas into clean, structured explanations.  
Great for building your “foundational principle” templates.

## 2\. The Structure of Scientific Revolutions — Thomas Kuhn

Explains how frameworks emerge, evolve, and collapse.  
Useful for understanding what a “theory” actually is and how your pieces will fit together.

## 3\. The Demon-Haunted World — Carl Sagan

A masterclass on skepticism, evidence, and understanding why some beliefs stick.  
The AI will use these patterns in research + principle-building.

## 4\. Maps of Meaning (Peterson)

Not for content — but for structure.  
It’s a textbook example of how to build an integrated model of human functioning.

---

## ⭐ 4. Assessments that help you understand your mind

The goal here isn’t diagnosis — it’s to give your agent **structures** to evaluate your patterns, tendencies, biases, and cognitive style.

### 1\. VIA Character Strengths Survey

Your values → essential for MI mode and meaning-layer theory-building.

### 2\. Big Five / IPIP-120

Very useful for modeling your cognitive tendencies and designing personalized reasoning prompts.

### 3\. Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT)

Shows how you default between intuition and analysis.

### 4\. MBTI (useful not scientifically, but structurally)

Helps map your cognitive preferences such as:

- intuition vs sensing
- structure vs improvisation
- internal vs external processing

### 5\. Kolb Learning Styles Inventory

Concrete experience vs abstract conceptualization  
Active experimentation vs reflective observation  
This directly affects question design.

### 6\. ADHD-specific tools

- ASRS
- Barkley Executive Functioning Scales
- Weiss Functional Impairment Rating

Useful not for diagnosis, but for:

- designing your system
- knowing where your model-building gets sticky
- adjusting your agent workflows

### 7\. Highly Sensitive Person (HSP) Scale

Given your deep processing style, this probably matters.

---

## ⭐ 5. Tools that help you observe your thinking

These are ideal for your AI to use as “mode switches.”

## 1\. Mind-mapping tools

- Excalidraw
- tldraw
- Markmap
- Mind-elixir  
	These externalize your associative thinking patterns.

## 2\. Concept mapping books/tools

- *Learning How to Learn* (Novak)
- CmapTools (open-source)  
	This teaches *how to represent knowledge structurally.*

## 3\. Cognitive interviewing frameworks

Used in UX and research to uncover hidden models.  
Perfect for your agent to borrow patterns like:

- “Tell me more about the moment you decided X…”
- “Walk me through your reasoning step by step…”
- “What made that assumption feel obvious?”

---

## ⭐ 6. Books on meaning, narrative, and identity

Because your therapeutic model will have an existential layer to it.

- **Man's Search for Meaning (Frankl)**
- **Self Comes to Mind (Damasio)**
- **The Evolved Self (Csikszentmihalyi)**
- **The Hero with a Thousand Faces (Campbell)**  
	To understand how people (including you) structure internal narratives.

---

## ⭐ 7. Putting it together — how the agent uses these resources

The agent uses each category strategically:

### To understand YOUR thinking:

- Big Five
- VIA
- ADHD scales
- Kolb’s learning style
- Cognitive reflection tests
- HSP scale
- Extended Mind
- Kahneman
- predictive processing / Mind is Flat

### To design QUESTIONS:

- Humble Inquiry
- Socratic Questioning
- MI
- A More Beautiful Question
- Appreciative Inquiry

### To design your THEORY-BUILDING METHODS:

- Surfing Uncertainty
- Structure of Scientific Revolutions
- Maps of Meaning (for structure)
- The Art of Explanation
- Damasio
- Constructivist / narrative materials

### To understand INFORMATION STORAGE & MEMORY:

- How We Learn
- Extended Mind
- Surfing Uncertainty
- A Mind for Numbers

## ⭐ If you want, I can now build:

**A) A “Core Cognitive Toolkit” — the exact 10 resources that give maximum leverage for your goals**  
**B) A plan for how your AI partner will *use* these resources (in modes: Socratic, MI, meta-cognitive, etc.)**  
**C) A custom assessment battery to map out *your* thinking style so the agent can adapt**  
**D) A reading + ingestion plan for your AI agent to build a grounded understanding of your cognition**

Which one should we do next?
